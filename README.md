# MRRAD (Multilingual Radiology Research Articles Dataset) 

See description of this dataset at [...].

BioPortal annotations are in [Standoff format](http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html).

NOBLE Coder annotations are in the default format output by the software. It was not possible to convert these annotatons to other, more popular format because of some of the annotation characteristics of NOBLE, including the possibility of non-contiguity of annotations.
