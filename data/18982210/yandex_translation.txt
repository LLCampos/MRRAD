 SUMMARY THE high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the imaging technique radiation that reflects more closely the changes of the structure of the lung. The various ct scan findings but can be combined to form typical patterns. These, together with the distribution of anatomical findings and with the clinical data, can narrow the diagnosis of diseases interstitial lung diffuse and, in many cases, suggest the correct diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy. The most common patterns of diseases interstitial lung diffuse in HRCT are the nodular, linear/reticular, cystic lesions, - glass opacities and consolidations. This article reviews the correlations between the patterns ct in HRCT and pathological findings, and summarizes the most common causes and the methods of investigation to reach a diagnosis of chronic lung diseases diffuse more common. Descriptors: lung Diseases, interstitial/pathology; computed Tomography X-ray; diagnostic Techniques of the respiratory system. Introduction The high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a critical tool for the evaluation of lung diseases. Seen that HRCT provides an assessment of anatomical global of the lungs, this imaging technique significantly improves the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis and histopathological. HRCT is particularly useful in the evaluation of diseases interstitial lung diffuse (DIPD), since there may be significant overlap in the clinical presentation and patterns, histopathological, as well as there may be a significant heterogeneity of the disease in the lungs. These arrangements together provide an approach to clinical, radiological and histopathological patient with DIPD, allowing a diagnosis accurate and streamlined management. Using thin sections and technical reconstruction of high-resolution, HRCT can detect abnormalities distinct up to 0.3 mm. In spite of this resolution be significantly lower than that of pathological examination (by ex., the typical objective of a microscope lower resolution has a diameter of field of 1 cm), HRCT does not allow the visualization of abnormalities at the level of the lobe pulmonary secondary. In this review, we present the patterns key of HRCT for DIPD, providing the clinical context and the correlations between histopathology of each standard. Technique There are several protocols in common use for obtaining images in HRCT. Table 1 shows examples of two of these protocols: images axial spaced and HRCT multidetector volumetric. Images thrust have the advantage of having a resolution a little better, and this technique has a low dosage of radiation. Images volumetric allow an assessment of the entire lung. In general, the images are obtained with patients in supine and ventral. In normal patients, opacities dependent are commonly seen in the posterior regions, and subpleurais of the lungs. In the case of some lung diseases diffuse as interstitial pneumonia non-specific (PINE), the images can be identical to those obtained from normal patients. The images in ventral decubitus differentiate these two possibilities, since the density-dependent normal lung later disappears with the images in ventral decubitus, while the density-related diseases truly lung persists. Dynamic images expiratórias are also obtained to track down trapping air. A standards-based approach to the diagnosis There are four general patterns of abnormalities on HRCT that are fundamental to your interpretation: 1) opacities reticular; 2) nodes; 3) opacity of the lung increased; and 4) opacity decreased pulmonary. Within each of these patterns, other aspects of the images can help to narrow the differential diagnosis, such as the distribution of abnormalities in the plans axial and coronal, as well as the co-occurrence/overlap of patterns. Our purpose in this article is to describe these basic patterns in HRCT, making correlations to clinical and histopathological important. For the interested reader, other works present histopathological findings in detail. (1) Default 1. Opacities reticular thickening of The network of connective tissue interstitial in the lungs results in opacities reticular morphology varied. This thickening may be due to infiltration of cells/liquids or deposition of fibrous tissue. The opacities reticular may be split between the thickening of the septa interlobulares, crosslinking is associated with bronchiectasis and traction faveolamento. Thickening of the septa interlobulares The thickening of the septa interlobulares (Figure 1) is defined as the thickening of the interstitium that surrounds and delineates the lobe pulmonary secondary. The lines of the septa tend to be straight and with 1-2 cm of length. The artery centrolobular, located in the center of the lobe in lung is usually visible. Some septa interlobulares are typically seen in normal patients. In patients with abnormalities, however, many can be viewed, outlining the lobes polygonal. It is important to emphasize that the thickening of the septa occur in a wide variety of diseases. This finding is most useful when it is the main abnormality, when the differential diagnosis is limited and dependent upon the type of thickening: smooth, nodular or irregular (Table 2). The clinical context, in particular the information in respect of the duration of the clinical symptoms and the time of the progress of the disease, is extremely useful in the interpretation of thickening of the septa interlobulares. Opacities reticular predominant Correlations clinical and histopathological pulmonary Edema Although HRCT is not usually required for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, it may be performed when there is a discrepancy between the clinical history and the findings on chest radiography. In the absence of a silhouette increased heart, echocardiography can reveal dysfunctions diastólicas, such as reflux, mitral, enlarged left atrium and high pressure of the pulmonary artery. The levels of natriuretic peptide brain can also be increased. (2) To rule out myocardial infarction, which may be asymptomatic, the levels of enzymes the heart must be determined, and an electrocardiogram should be performed. High levels of creatinine may indicate renal failure as underlying disease, another cause of pulmonary edema. Figure 2 shows an example of pulmonary edema from lung biopsy. Linfangite disseminated Metastases of linfangite in the lungs can result also of tumors, lung and extrapulmonares. Sources extratorácicas common include breast, stomach, pancreas, and prostate. (3) When metastases of the linfangite originating from a tumor is lung primary, metastases are commonly unilateral, with the visualization of a nodule or mass. (4) In the presence of a history of primary tumor, the typical findings on HRCT can be considered as diagnoses. In the absence of a history of primary tumor, the diagnosis requires confirmation cell or tissue (lavado broncoalveolar [LBA], collection of pleural fluid, biopsy transbrônquica or lung biopsy surgical). (5) How such tumors are typically distributed between the lymphatic vessels of the beams broncovasculares, the biopsy through the fibrobroncoscopia is a method that is highly effective (Figure 3). Sarcoidosis The diagnosis of sarcoidosis requires a finding of granulomas non-necrotizantes in biopsy combined with clinical and radiological findings that are consistent with the disease. It is of utmost importance to rule out other causes of granulomatous diseases (especially tuberculosis). (6) the sites of The biopsies should be the easiest to access, such as the skin and lymph nodes superficial. In some cases, the fibrobroncoscopia with biopsy of bronchial and transbrônquica is required and, as a last resort, mediastinoscopy or lung biopsy surgical. The presence of nodules is the finding the key of the sarcoidosis lung, found in ≈90% of all cases. Such nodules are widely distributed but tend to concentrate around structures broncovasculares, pleura and septa interlobulares. (7) The biopsy transbrônquica is highly effective in the confirmation of the diagnosis (Figure 4). The adenopathy hilar is a finding to be expected, and there may be a confluence of nodules between parenchymatous opacity more extensive. In the signs of late disease, there may be the presence of fibrosis, manifested by reticulation irregular, bronchiectasis traction and masses of confluent tissue basement membranes. Disease Erdheim-Chester disease Erdheim-Chester is a rare langerhans systemic that affects typically the long bones, with lung involvement in 15% of cases. (8) The disease is today recognized as a condition distinct from the forms systemic of langerhans cell Histiocytosis (HCL). One should consider the diagnosis of disease Erdheim-Chester in male patients with more than 40 years of age presenting with bone pain, diffuse and DIPD. In such cases, one must rule out the diagnosis of carcinoma metastatic. In patients with disease Erdheim-Chester, pulmonary involvement is suggested by the presence of shadows reticular symmetrical in chest radiography, thickening of the septa interlobulares (on chest radiography and computed tomography), opacities nodular centrolobulares, - glass opacities and thickening of the fissures. The pathology is distinct, showing mild fibrosis in the pleura and along the lymphatic vessels of the septa interlobulares. Contrary to what is observed in patients with HCL, the histiócitos of patients with the disease Erdheim-Chester present results immunohistochemical negative for protein S100 and CD1a but positive for CD68. Pulmonary lesions lymphoid lesions of The lung lymphoid constitute a general category of disease that includes bronchiolitis follicular hyperplasia, lymphoid nodular, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and lymphoma, low-grade. (9) In rare cases, the lymphoid hyperplasia may simulate sarcoidosis, seen that the involvement is concentrated along the septa, in areas subpleurais and around the airways (all of the local lymphatic channels in the lung). Bronchiectasis traction dilatation of bronchi as a consequence of interstitial fibrosis is referred to as bronchiectasis traction (Figure 5). The bronchial tubes usually have jagged appearance (corkscrew) and are not associated with evidence of radiological of bronchial inflammation (thickening coarse of the bronchial wall or impaction mucoid). Bronchiectasis traction is usually accompanied by other signs of pulmonary fibrosis (faveolamento or reticulation irregular). In spite of bronchiectasis traction to be quite specific to the fibrosis, the differential diagnosis is broader than that for faveolamento. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (FPI) is commonly associated with bronchiectasis traction. However, in the absence of faveolamento, other diseases are more likely (Table 3). In patients with a history of disease collagen vascular, bronchiectasis traction bibasal peripheral and, accompanied by attenuation in frosted glass, can be considered as diagnostic of PINE. When the circumstances are less diagnostic may be required a surgical biopsy. Faveolamento The remodeling of the lung in honeycomb (faveolamento) reflects the stage terminal of a number of diseases that cause destruction of the parenchyma. Presents a characteristic pattern on HRCT, with cysts subpleurais with thick walls that share walls and, when advanced, usually form piles in multiple layers (Figure 6). It is typically accompanied by other signs of fibrosis (bronchiectasis traction and reticulation). The faveolamento strongly suggests a pathological diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia usual (PIU), although it can be attributed to other diseases (Table 3). The faveolamento observed on HRCT is usually considered as a diagnosis of PIU in patients presenting with a clinical profile suitable, and the majority of these patients do not require lung biopsy surgical. As the faveolamento bilateral on HRCT is considered diagnostic under these conditions, it is of vital importance that the radiologist can be sure that the faveolamento is present before you describe it. Correlations to clinical and histopathological idiopathic pulmonary Fibrosis A finding of PIU in lung biopsy surgical is characteristic of the FPI, and that is the idiopathic chronic pulmonary fibrosis. The histopathology of the PIU presents the alternation between fibrosis destructive and lung-normal in the specimen from surgical biopsy (Figures 7 and 8). An edge characteristic of the lesion focal advances is always present and is known as "foci fibroblásticos". The criteria of clinical diagnosis for the PIU have been proposed by a consensus between the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society in 2000. (10) Since then, the following aspects became evident:  The presence of faveolamento is required for a reliable diagnosis from HRCT (that is, abnormalities reticular pattern in frosted glass minimum are not sufficient). (11)  The biopsy transbrônquica is rarely indicated as a diagnostic tool of the suspected cases. (12)  The disease is unusual in patients under 50 years of age. (13)  asymptomatic Patients may present with the disease. Based on these observations, the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of the FPI must include all of the following aspects:  age > 50 years  the exclusion of other potential causes of interstitial lung disease (DPI), such as exposure to environmental or occupational-significant, use of drugs fibrogênicas and diseases of the collagen vascular.  abnormal results in pulmonary function testing including evidence of restriction, gas exchange is compromised (at rest or under stress) or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO, diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide) reduced  rales inspiratory bibasais  findings in HRCT abnormalities reticular bibasais with faveolamento and the absence of findings suggestive of other diseases (for ex., trapping air, nodules centrolobulares and-glass opacities extensive) The specificity of these findings is approximately 90% for FPI. (14) Diseases of the collagen vascular diseases, rheumatic can produce pulmonary fibrosis. Rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are predominantly involved in the cases where a default PIU is found on the HRCT scan, and abnormal functional similar. Pneumonitis hypersensitivity hypersensitivity Reactions to antigens organic inhalational comprise a group of lung diseases diffuse mediated by reactions of the immune and caused by the inhalation of repeating a wide variety of dust organic, bioaerosols, and chemical compounds. These diseases are collectively classified as pneumonitis, hypersensitivity (PH). The continued exposure to such antigens typically occurs in the households. In Brazil, it is especially associated with poultry and the large concentrations of mold within the environments. (15) In PH chronic, findings on HRCT suggestive of fibrosis are present and relate to a worse prognosis. The faveolamento is common in the forms of chronic. In a study conducted in Brazil, the faveolamento was present in 48 (57%) of the 85 patients who underwent lung biopsy surgical. (16) The disease was restricted to the wolves higher in only 11 cases. However, when there was involvement of the wolves below, other findings suggestive of PH, such as nodules centrolobulares, areas of attenuation decreased, the areas of attenuation in frosted glass and distribution peribrônquica of injuries, were commonly present. In biopsy specimens, this is translated as infiltration and interstitial chronic inflammatory, concentrated around the airways and often accompanied by bronchiolitis and chronic small granulomas interstitial non-necrotizantes. In only 6% of the cases, the CT scan revealed distribution peripheral faveolamento, mimicking PIU. None of the patients presented lesions similar to the PIU in the biopsies of the lungs. These findings are similar to those of other studies. (17,18) In patients with lung disease fibrosante and exposed to antigens to trigger PH, a clinical diagnosis can be accepted provided that the context of the TC is appropriate, and the cytology of the BAL reveals lymphocytosis. (19) Sarcoidosis fibrosante (stage IV) advanced Fibrosis (stage IV) in sarcoidosis (sarcoidosis fibrosante) is found in less than 10% of the cases. Sarcoidosis fibrosante occurs predominantly in the upper lung regions, in central distribution/dorsal, distortion of the bronchial and in the cracks. Masses conglomeradas hilares-perhilares are common. Lines, septal thickening broncovascular, micronodules, and adenopathy (sometimes with calcifications) can be observed. When there is faveolamento, this is peripheral and involves the areas in the upper lung. (20) A pattern simulating PIU is very rare and, in this situation, there may be fewer granulomas than in the early stages of the disease. The confirmation histopathological sarcoidosis can be obtained by biopsy of bronchial or transbrônquica (positive in 60-80%),(20,21) biopsies in other sites or, rarely, by pulmonary biopsy surgical. Interstitial Pneumonia non-specific and was Originally described in 1994 by Katzenstein and Fiorelli,(22) the PINE was presented as a new form of DRI idiopathic, separate and distinct from those proposed in the original classification by Leibow. (23) A DIPD inflammatory characterized by uniformity over time of the disease process, the PINE presents varying degrees of inflammation, interstitial or fibrosis. It is rare a disease is purely inflammatory. The prognosis is better in cases of PINE than in PIU. Patients with PINE tend to be younger than patients with IVT (average age, 53 vs. 67 years). The majority of cases occur in the context of an underlying disease, such as connective tissue disease, lung disease, drug-induced or PH chronic. (24) The standard histopathological PINE is the pattern predominantly found in most of the rheumatic diseases, especially systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis/polymyositis, and connective tissue disease not differentiated; this last has been described as a new distinct entity. (25) The standard PINE is a common presentation of the PH. (26) However, in such cases, the distribution in HRCT is very different from that of the PINE associated with `disease collagen vascular or reaction to drugs. The differentiation through HRCT is especially useful due to the typical findings of histology of PH, such as granulomas, cells, giant, and pneumonia bronquiolocêntrica the interstitial, which are absent by definition. Various aspects on HRCT suggest a diagnosis of PINE. (27) Although the PIU presents the same predominantly subpleural and basilar, - glass opacities, which are rare in PIU, are found in more than 75% of the cases of PINE. Abnormalities reticular, with or without bronchiectasis traction, are common and seem to correlate with the amount of fibrosis seen on histopathology. In-plane axial, the preservation subpleural (a thin border of the lung preserved in the interface pleuroparenquimatosa) and the trace of opacities along the beams broncovasculares of the lower areas are two findings that correlate with the histopathological findings of PINE. The faveolamento is rare in PINE, and discusses whether this should be a finding for the exclusion. In the original sample of 64 patients described by Katzenstein and Fiorelli, the mortality was low and there was not the presence of faveolamento microscopic in any of the patients. (22) In a later study conducted by Travis et al.,(28) patients with faveolamento microscopic were included, and the survival rate decreased significantly. Later the these clinical studies, the occurrence is reported of faveolamento in TC in patients with PINE has been variable, ranging between 0% and 30% (average 20%). (29-34) On the other hand, the faveolamento extensive is an expression much more common in the PIU. (35) The findings for PINE described above are nonspecific. Therefore, in the absence of a definition for disease collagen vascular or exposure to drugs fibrogênicas, it is required to perform lung biopsy surgical. Some cases of interstitial pneumonia descamativa (PID), PH (with or without findings histological classics), and various diseases, less common, can also produce this pattern. Pneumopatia drug-induced Diseases due to the toxicity of drugs can result in DIPD, with reactions histopathological ranging from acute injuries to standards fibróticos similar to those of the PIU. (36) The mechanisms of lung injury induced by drugs vary between cytotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. A wide variety of reactions related to therapy have been described as a consequence of the use of chemotherapeutic agents (bleomycin, bussulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosouréia and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosouréia), statins, amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, methotrexate, and radiation therapy thoracic. It is usually required to perform bronchoscopy with biopsy of bronchial to rule out infection. The lung biopsy surgery is not specific to a particular drug in the great majority of cases. (37) Asbestosis asbestosis is a pneumoconiosis caused by the inhalation of fibres of asbestos and is characterized by slow progression of pulmonary fibrosis. In the early stages of the disease, a pattern reticular irregular is the finding of typical HRCT scan, whereas a standard cysts is characteristic of the advanced stage. Asbestosis affects workers involved in the extraction of minerals as well as those who work in the manufacturing and installation of products containing asbestos (industrial textiles, insulation and manufactured products of the cement). The interstitial fibrosis related to asbestosis varies in appearance. In some cases, the fibrosis is not histopatologicamente differentiated from the PIU,(38) although, in the majority of cases, asbestosis is a lung disease fibrotic associated to the airways and does not display the accentuation of peripheral-lobular typical of the PIU. Bands parenchymatous, are most commonly resulting from the asbestosis. Asbestosis can be diagnosed without lung biopsy in the presence of three clinical signs (a restrictive pattern of lung impairment, DLCO below the lower limit of the normal range and rales fine bilateral in the lung base later) in combination with opacities irregular (on chest radiograph or HRCT scan), and a history of relevant exposure. (39) A diagnosis of asbestosis can also be reached based on the co-occurrence of DPI and pleural plaques typical in CT. A find of fragments of asbestos in the fluid obtained by BAL is highly specific. (40) Standard 2. Nodules There are several ways to classify nodules: well-defined vs. ill-defined; the distribution in the lobes the upper vs. lower; and its relationship with the lobes of the lungs secondary. This last is the feature most helpful, since it provides a differential diagnosis focused and reflects the pathophysiology of the underlying disease. There are three distributions possible of nodules on HRCT: perilymphatic, random, and centrolobular (Tables 4, 5 and 6). Nodules perilinfáticos Correlations clinical and histopathological Nodules perilinfáticos are characterized by their distribution in the sheath broncovascular, pleura and septa interlobulares, corresponding to the lymphatic pathways in the lung (Figure 9). All the conditions in this category necessarily have an affinity for lymphatic channels. Sarcoidosis granulomatousA sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease non-infectious with likely origin immune. The distribution of granulomas nodular along the lymphatic pathways is virtually diagnostic of sarcoidosis on HRCT. The lung biopsy from the bronchoscopy may be required for the diagnosis of cases with no lesions in sites more accessible, such as skin (except erythema nodosum, in which the biopsy shows nonspecific findings) or to lymph nodes superficial. A high degree of diagnostic accuracy is achieved if more than four samples are obtained at bronchoscopy. This is possible because the lymphatic channels traverse the beams broncovasculares in large numbers and, therefore, are widely obtained in the sample from biopsy transbrônquica. (41) in addition, for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the sensitivity and specificity of a CD4/CD8 > 3.5 in the liquid of the LBA are 52-59% and 94-96%, respectively. (42) Figure 4 shows the lung biopsy surgery of a patient with sarcoidosis. The distribution of lymphatic can be striking and summarize the findings in HRCT. Linfangite disseminated For information about findings on HRCT in cases of linfangite disseminated, see above the item thickening of the septa interlobulares. Silicosis/silicatose The inhalation of significant quantities of silica dust, to be pure, to be mixed with the silicates of aluminum and magnesium, is responsible for the pneumoconiosis is known as silicatose or silicosis. Nodules visible in pictures thoracic occur primarily as the manifestation of an occupational disease, with nodules in the regions centrolobular and subpleural. The nodules are distributed in the regions top and middle of the lungs, with predominance later. Since the disease can persist or progress, even in cases when the exposure to silica particles is broken, one should perform a detailed history from the patient. Given the long latency of the disease, you should pay special attention to the earlier occupations, even those that occurred in the remote past. The prevalence of silicosis remains high in certain areas of professional activity in Brazil, such as in mining in general, metallurgy and production of ceramic tiles or porcelain, and sand blasting. (43) The diagnosis of silicosis is based on the interpretation and analysis of x-rays as well as in the professional history of the worker/patient. The histopathological examination is limited to cases where there is discrepancy between these two analyses, raising therefore the possibility of other diagnoses. (43) The biopsy transbrônquica is diagnostic in most cases. Hyperplasia lymphoid nodular Currently, has struggled considerably over the hyperplasia lymphoid nodular diffuse in the lung. The lesions are located around the airways and lymph in the lung. Histopathology reveals numerous lymphoid follicles apparently reactive with centers germinativos. The diagnosis of lymphoma low-grade B-cell type marginal zone should be discarded. Hyperplasia lymphoid nodular diffuse in the lung can be a pre-neoplastic, and in some cases are related to a deficiency of immunoglobulins, Sjögren's syndrome, or a combination between autoimmune disease and Sjögren's syndrome. (44,45) Amyloidosis amyloidosis is a disorder of the folding protein of the immunoglobulin in which plasma proteins normally soluble aggregate form of fibrillar insoluble and abnormal, causing disruption of the structure of the tissue and of the organic function. The deposit amyloid diffuse in the lung parenchyma is usually associated with the impairment of other organ systems. Nodules perilinfáticos are a rare manifestation of amyloidosis. (46) Nodules with random distribution Nodules with random distribution are defined by their occurrence in seemingly random regions peribroncovasculares, septa interlobulares, and pleura, without a pattern perilinfático consistent and the absence of a consistent relation with lobe pulmonary secondary. Figure 10 shows the HRCT of a patient with metastases hematogênicas of thyroid cancer. Correlations to clinical and histopathological Metastasis hematogênica metastasis hematogênica is the most common cause of the random distribution of multiple nodules. The dominance of the core is typical due to the blood flow preferential to the bases of the lungs. Since the malignant cells penetrate into the lymphatic vessels of the lungs, are common aspects of linfangite other side effects with septa interlobulares with thickened and irregular pleural effusion. In biopsies of lung surgical, nodules, and irregular tumors endovasculares and endolinfáticos are present (Figure 3). Although the appearance of lumps military has many causes, the most common are metastasis, tuberculosis, fungal infections, and sarcoidosis. (47) Metastases military are often sourced from cancer of the thyroid, kidney cancer, melanoma and other types of cancer, whereas metastases to the largest and less abundant tend to be adenocarcinomas in adults, typically originating in the lungs, breast, or gastrointestinal tract. Miliary tuberculosis The miliary tuberculosis is usually insidious. Reports of performance trials of lung tissue and secretion in studies of miliary tuberculosis vary widely, probably in part due to the great diversity of cases included in these studies. Overall, 50% of the samples of sputum collected from suspected cases have positive results in culture. In a study conducted in South Africa,(48) granulomas were found in 30 (63%) of 48 biopsies transbrônquicas, 20 of which had necrosis. Of the 30 presenting granulomas, 13 were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on sputum smear. Two sites likely to be of involvement and accessible for study are the liver and the bone marrow. Between liver biopsies, 88% have granulomas; 45%, granulomas necrotizantes; and 40%, BAAR. Between biopsies of bone marrow, 67% have granulomas; 42%, granulomas necrotizantes; and 42%, BAAR. (49) fungal Infections military Histoplasmosis acute disseminated is an unusual presentation of fungal infection miliary in adults. In patients with a miliary pattern and granulomas in biopsies transbrônquicas, without necrosis or infectious agents, a lung biopsy open pit may be required for disposing infectious diseases and to establish a diagnosis of sarcoidosis more conclusive. Nodules centrolobulares the central part of The lobe pulmonary secondary contains the branches of the bronchioles terminals, with their respective pulmonary arteries, and adjacent to, the supporting connective tissue with lymphatic vessels. Therefore, opacities nodular centrolobulares may be the product of diseases bronquiolares and peribronquiolares as well as diseases of the vascular and perivascular. Attenuation in the mosaic associated with the entrapment of air in the HRCT scan expiratory, or evidence of functional obstruction of airflow indicates disease involving the peripheral airways. Nodules centrolobulares are sometimes accompanied by the so-called shade-tree in budding", in which the abnormality resembles a tree sprouting (Figure 13). In most cases, the tree pattern in budding occurs as a result of infectious diseases. Tree budding is a subtype of the standard centrolobular. Pathologically, this abnormality represents impaction bronquiolar and is almost always due to infections. Table 7 details the differential diagnosis. Correlations to clinical and histopathological Pneumonitis hypersensitivity subacute Numerous nodules centrolobulares in frosted glass, ill-defined and with uniform distribution are characteristic of the PH sub-acute (Figure 11). (50) This diagnosis can be confirmed by history of exposure, clinical symptoms with symptoms similar to the flu, lymphocytosis in liquid LBA and clinical improvement when the patient is away from the environmental agent aggressor. In the phase sub-acute, the pulmonary biopsy in the surgical shows characteristic findings (bronchiolitis, chronic interstitial pneumonia and cellular granulomas non-necrotizantes malformed and sparse on the walls, alveolar and regions peribronquiolares; Figure 12), especially when the antigens of birds are responsible. Plasma cells are typically prominent in the interstitium in the PH. Bronchiolitis respiratory-associated interstitial lung disease Bronchiolitis respiratory-associated interstitial lung disease (BR-DPI) appears to exist among a spectrum of DIPDs related to smoking, sometimes coexisting with HCL. Typically, BR-DPI produces nodules centrolobulares poorly defined in small quantity and predominantly in the lobes the upper. In the cases of BR-DPI, the findings on HRCT can simulate the PH sub-acute, with abnormalities nodular poorly formed and scattered with areas of hypoattenuation (standard tile). However, the history of the patient is in general useful (BR-DPI occurs only in smokers, whereas PH is rare in smokers) and the profile of the LBA is usually definitive in distinguishing between IPR and PH. Both in the BR-DPI as in bronchiolitis, occurs a brown pigmentation characteristic in macrophages. The difference in histopathological resides in the extension of the reaction of macrophages peribronquiolares (much larger in the BR-DPI). The findings in the LBA, in addition to the personal history and the findings on HRCT usually allow to diagnose the BR-DPI without the need of lung biopsy through toracoscopia. (51) Langerhans of Langerhans cells In smokers, nodules centrolobulares poorly defined can also be viewed in the initial stage of HCL, without the presence of cysts. Seen that HLC is a disease based in the airways, a finding in biopsy transbrônquica injury of HCL is not unexpected. The cells of Langerhans can be found in the fluid of the LBA of patients with one of several types of inflammatory conditions, potentially producing a false-positive result if this modality is used as a diagnostic test for HCL. (41) The understanding of the findings of the CT scan is essential for diagnosis accurate. The incidence exact of HCL in the population, the tobacco remains unknown. (52) Bronchiolitis follicular hyperplasia lymphoid reactive, present in a distribution peribronquiolar, is known as bronchiolitis follicular. In the literature, radiological and pathology, bronchiolitis follicular and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia are considered as representatives of two extremes of a spectrum; the first being located in the regions peribronquiolares and the second, more diffuse. Baseline conditions associated with the bronchiolitis follicular include rheumatoid disease collagen vascular mixed, Sjögren's syndrome, other auto-immune diseases and immunodeficiency syndrome hereditary or acquired. (53,54) The disease can occur in the form idiopathic. Pneumonia, infectious In the host immune compromised, bacterial infections (Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae), fungal (most commonly Aspergillus spp.) and, very rarely, viral, can result in a tree pattern in budding accompanied by the consolidation variable (including cytomegalovirus and respiratory syncytial virus). (55) Bronchiolitis infectious In the normal host, the bronchiolitis diffuse acute without consolidation associated with (Figure 14) can occasionally result from viral infection or mycoplasma. (56,57) Bronchiectasis residual may result. PH, that can also show nodules centrolobulares diffuse, virtually never has injuries in the form of a tree budding. Dissemination endobrônquica of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically produces a pattern of the tree in budding, which indicates active disease. Cavitation is associated with is highly suggestive of the disease but may be absent. (58) Infection by the complex M. avium-intracellulare When the tree pattern in budding is found in a patient older caucasian, the infection by the complex M. avium-intracellulare should always be considered. The manifestations radiological consist of bronchiectasis and nodules centrolobulares multiple. The disease is most severe in the língula and in the middle lobe. (59) The examination of sputum and culture are essential to the establishment of the diagnosis of infection by mycobacteria. Bronchoscopy may be required to obtain secretions and biopsies for culture. Bronchiectasis Diseases that result in bronchiectasis are often accompanied by injuries of the tree into budding. (60) In cystic fibrosis, the pattern of the tree in budding can be an early sign of the disease. Panbronquiolite diffuse panbronquiolite fuzzy is a disease histopatologicamente characteristic represented by a inflammatory condition with involvement extensive peripheral airway, producing a pattern of tree budding with or without bronchiectasis associated. Although the term panbronquiolite diffuse implies an inflammatory disease generic of the bronchioles, the histopathology is sufficiently distinct that, when found, is rarely forgotten and not easily confused with other disorders inflammatory. The disease is described primarily in patients of asian origin. However, some cases have been described in brazilian without asian origin. (61,62) The disease is predominantly identified between the second and fifth decades of life. Chronic sinusitis is common. In western countries, where the disease is rare, a lung biopsy is usually required for the diagnosis. (63) The biopsy transbrônquica or open to the sky shows a accumulation distinct histiócitos sparkling on the walls bronquiolares and in the regions peribronquiolares immediate. (64) Bronchiolitis aspiration diffuse inflammatory reaction chronic to the aspiration repeated foreign material results in bronchiolitis aspiration diffuse. (65) the Conditions which favor the aspiration, such as disorders oesophageal and defects, neurological defects, are typically found. Bronchiolitis follicular The bronchiolitis follicular is a rare cause of the pattern of the tree in budding, and a lot more unusual in its diffuse form. Pistons tumor In rare cases, emboli of tumor can expand the small vessels and produce a tree pattern in budding. (55) clinical Approach to the diagnosis of patients with opacities centrolobulares In the cases of tree pattern in budding and nodules centrolobulares (with or without attenuation alveolar/frosted glass), the lung biopsy transbrônquica and LBA are the methods of choice for diagnosing infections (tuberculosis, fungi, viruses, and bacterial pneumonia lobular), cancer (squamous cell carcinoma broncoalveolares and linfangite other side effects and disorders lung inflammatory criptogênicos (PH, HCL, and sarcoidosis). (66) If the biopsy transbrônquica and LBA are negative, you can be required a lung biopsy to surgery. Standard 3. Opacity pulmonary increased Opacity of the lung increased may be described as opacity of frosted glass-or a consolidation. The opacity of frosted glass (Figure 15) is an opacity of the lung increased that does not obscures the vessels associated with and represents abnormalities below the resolution of HRCT. The consolidation (Figure 16) is an opacity of the lung is increased in which the vessels are obscured and represents a disease confluent. These findings are very nonspecific and can reflect diseases that are primarily alveolar, interstitial or mixed. The differential diagnosis between opacity of frosted glass and consolidation often is overlapped and is predominantly based on the duration of the symptoms: acute or chronic (Table 8). The distribution of the findings (focal, segmented, or diffuse/symmetric) can be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis (Table 9). The consolidation parenchymal and the opacity of frosted glass are the findings on HRCT that have been associated with lung disease active or reversible. However, the opacity of frosted glass can also be found in cases in which the fibrosis is the abnormal predominant. The attenuation in frosted glass can only be considered as indicative of the presence of disease potentially reversible if there are no findings of fibrosis associated with in the same area. The differential diagnosis of-glass opacities and consolidation should be based on the immunological status of the host, and the duration of symptoms. The presence of connective tissue diseases, inhalants, environmental, and drug use should also be considered when there is the presence of opacity, diffuse pulmonary increased. Opacity increased acute Correlations clinical and histopathological pulmonary Edema The most common cause of disorders diffuse pulmonary acute with-glass opacities/consolidation is pulmonary edema. In edema, hydrostatic, there is usually a combination of thickening of the septa and glass opacities. The size of the heart may be normal or increased. The thickening of the interstitium perihilar and peribroncovascular (thickening peribrônquico) and cracks are common. The distribution of the vascular is balanced or reversed. Opacities centrolobulares ill-defined and indistinct can also be viewed. The edema hydrostatic tends to present a distribution perihilar and gravitational. In edema non-cardiogenic, the size of the heart is normal, the distribution of the vascular is normal or balanced, and the distribution of the edema is segmented or peripheral. The thickening peribrônquico lines and septal are usually absent. (67) respiratory distress Syndrome acute The acute respiratory distress syndrome acute (ARDS) may be the result of a wide variety of pulmonary lesions, including trauma, aspiration, sepsis, and pneumonia-infectious. (68) The distribution of abnormalities on CT scan are typically bilateral, dependent on the severity and pronounced in the lung bases. When SARA is caused by lung disease, tends to be asymmetric with a mix of consolidation and opacity of frosted glass, whereas when caused by disease extra-pulmonary features predominantly opacity of frosted glass-symmetric. Both edema hydrostatic and SARA commonly present with pleural effusion and broncogramas air. Bronchiectasis traction in damage to the alveolar diffuse (DAD) suggests that the disease is in phase proliferative or fibrotic. (69) Infections bacterial Pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia, especially when caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella, or other agents including micoplasmas, can result in pneumonia, fulminant, with SARA. Pneumocystis jiroveci. Pneumocystis jiroveci should always be considered. Cystic changes accompanied by glass opacities diffuse highly suggest this infection but are found in less than one-third of all cases. Pneumonia due to cytomegalovirus. The pneumonia by cytomegalovirus can lead to interstitial pneumonia and, in severe cases, DAD. The finding more useful in the differentiation of infectious causes of non-infectious lung disease with diffuse acute in the normal host is the presence of nodules centrolobulares. When present in the distribution-targeted, these suggest infectious disease. (70) Pneumonitis hypersensitivity Nodules centrolobulares opacity frosted glass distributed diffusely and profusely through the lungs are characteristic of PH. In other cases, areas of attenuation in frosted glass, nodules centrolobulares and opacificações of the airspace targeted with micronodules are seen. In the acute stage, the consolidation of the air space can be found. (50) Hemorrhage alveolar diffuse (HAD) THE HAD, defined as bleeding active within the parenchyma alveolar, produces opacity in lung increased. Various are the causes of HAD. The renal impairment should always be suggestive of an etiology of vasculitis or connective tissue disease. When the HAD occurs as a phenomenon immune, is frequently accompanied by vasculitis and systemic, in such cases, serologic studies are essential for diagnosis and management. (71) Haemoptysis may be absent. Figure 17 shows a sample of lung biopsy surgery of a patient with wegener's Granulomatosis who presented with hemoptysis and opacity of frosted glass-perihilar. To avoid confusion with bleeding from trauma caused by the biopsy procedure, HAD never should be diagnosed in the absence of siderófagos and fibrin, signs that the bleeding is a manifestation of true injury immune (the cause of the majority of the cases HAD). Although they may occur confusion with a patient with acute hemorrhage associated with the airways (such as observed in bronchiectasis), this is almost always a phenomenon of segmental or lobar rather diffuse. Interstitial Pneumonia acute (PIA) in THE form idiopathic DAD is defined clinically as a SINK, which is the same entity clinicopatológica idiopathic described by Hamman and Rich in 4 patients. (72) Patients with PIA have respiratory symptoms and progressive respiratory failure that occur in the course of days to weeks. The disease differs from other forms of DATA by the absence of a cause identifiable disease or predisposing. The diagnosis to be disposed of is the of infection, and specific staining for organisms (in the minimum, technique Grocott for fungi and pneumocistos) should always be carried out, as well as in all cases of DAD. The biopsy shows membranes hialinas aligned to the spaces-cellular, typically with the organization interstitial and air space when the biopsy is performed. (73) The findings on CT are typically indistinguishable from those of the SAHARA and include consolidation of airspace bilateral extensive and area-targeted or diffuse attenuation in frosted glass. Bronchiectasis traction is usually visible as a manifestation of late in the areas of consolidation, air space or attenuation in frosted glass. Some patients with IVT (or other pneumonias interstitial) can experience a course precipitate, with periods of sharp deterioration of the status of respiratory, associated with the DAD and the other manifestations of injury in acute. (74) The baqueteamento digital is limited to patients with acute exacerbations of lung disease, fibrotic base and serves as an indication useful to distinguish them from patients with the SINK. Pneumonitis caused by radiation Manifestations pulmonary acute may occur approximately 8 weeks after the end of radiation therapy with doses of 40 Gy or more. Irradiation of the chest is a relatively unusual opacity in lung increased acute. (75) interstitial lung Disease induced by drugs interstitial lung disease induced by drugs (opacity pulmonary acute) may have various manifestations, histopathological, including DAD, pneumonia eosinophilic pneumonia organization (PO) e. in rare cases, bleeding of the lungs. (36,37) in addition, a single medicine can cause reactions histological different patients several. It was evidenced that the home hemodialysis is associated with many pharmacological agents, especially among these are the chemotherapeutic agents such as bleomycin. Connective tissue disease related interstitial lung disease such As drugs, auto-immune diseases systemic can produce a wide variety of patterns, histopathological. (76) In patients previously diagnosed with connective tissue disease (DTC), DAD or PO acute can occur-or the pneumonitis may represent the initial manifestation of the disease, especially in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, and Still's disease adult. (77,78) Creatine fosfoquinase and ferritin serum should be measured in order to assess these last two diseases. Pneumonia, eosinophilic acute pneumonia eosinophilic acute may occur in asthmatic patients but can also be due to the use of medications and illicit drugs or even due to the high consumption of cigarettes. Described a way idiopathic. Only one-third of the patients have a high score of eosinophils peripheral. The LBA shows esosinófilos > 25%. (79) The treatment of the patient with even a single dose of corticosteroid prior to biopsy can greatly reduce the number of eosinophils in the tissue and, therefore, complicate the diagnostic evaluation. Pneumonia in the organization of The pulmonary lesion in the organization, due to any cause, may be clinically acute, resulting in a presentation of respiratory failure. (80) The acute form of non-infectious can be idiopathic, associated with DTC, or related to the toxicity of drugs. An intermediate shape between DAD and OP, called pneumonia fibrinosa acute and in organization, is characterized by exudates alveolar fibrinous lavishly, although without membranes hialinas. By definition, does not occur the infection. Pneumonia fibrinosa acute and in the organization can be idiopathic or associated with a base condition, or concomitant, such as disease collagen vascular, reaction to drugs and occupational exposure. Clinical management The DIPDs non-infectious acute usually have symptoms that are consistent with those of pneumonia. (81) Patients suspected of having SARA on the basis of pneumonia, and those who have SARA but without a predisposing condition set should be submitted to the LBA and, depending on the results of a lung biopsy, to rule out one of the forms of DIPD non-infectious acute lymphocytosis (>25%) in liquid LBA is the rule in the PH. A predominance of neutrophils in the fluid of the LBA suggests DAD or infection; blood samples sequential LBA indicates HAD eosinophilia or pneumonia eosinophilic acute. In the setting of lung disease acute, the infection always tops the list of differential diagnoses. Biopsies transbrônquicas, washed bronchial and LBA have a crucial role in the clinical evaluation. When fibrin membranes hialinas or organization in the spaces alveolar are identified, the differential diagnosis includes infection, toxicity of drugs, DTC, and SINK. (1) specific Staining for bacterial infections, fungal and mycobacteria should be carried out. In the absence of these agents, a careful search of changes citopáticas is recommended, especially if the patient is immune compromised and, in particular, if there is necrosis. In the cases of PH acute, the biopsy can reveal DAD with typical findings of PH (granulomas and pneumonitis mobile). The causes of DAD diagnosed by lung biopsy surgical have been described in some studies. (82,83) The most common causes are infections and SINK. Other important causes are DTC, exacerbation of FPI and the use of drugs. The infections are more common in hosts immunocompromised. In selected patients with SARA clinical, biopsy of the open sky can be safely performed, usually revealing a diagnosis unsuspected and lead to changes in therapy. (82) Consolidation chronic/opacity of frosted glass-The patient previously healthy who has dyspnea, chronic light and opacity of frosted glass (or consolidation diffuse) should be investigated as to PH, PID, BR-DPI, PINE, SINK, OP, bronchiolitis obliterans with pneumonia in the organization, pneumonia eosinophilic chronic (PEC) and sarcoidosis. (84) Rarely patients present some of the causes of atypical consolidation chronic/opacity of frosted glass, such as proteinose alveolar pulmonar (PAP), carcinoma broncoalveolar (CBA) and lymphoma. Although the opacity of frosted glass, and the consolidation may denote disease interstitial or alveolar,(85) the opacity of frosted glass is more commonly found in PH, PID, BR-DPI and PINE. The consolidation is mainly found in the PO, the SGP and the CBA. Smoking history may be an additional factor important in this population. Patients with PID or BR-DPI are almost exclusively smokers. The findings in LBA in this group of diseases can be highly specific and can directly confirm a diagnosis or condition-specific, supplanting effectively the lung biopsy. Diseases diffuse introducing opacity pulmonary increased chronic and is usually diagnosed through the LBA include proteinose alveolar, CBA and SGP. In addition, the cytology of LBA support combined with clinical features and HRCT scan is often sufficient for the diagnosis of PH (lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages sparkling) or PO (celularidade mixed and low ratio CD4/CD8). (86) Correlations between clinical and histopathological Pneumonitis hypersensitivity In the normal host, non-smoker and without heart failure, the most common cause of opacity of frosted glass-is PH. (84) In the PH, the opacity of frosted glass indicates disease subacute. With relevant exposure, a pattern of opacity of frosted glass associated with nodules centrolobulares and trapping air lobular (the so-called standard head-cheese or terrine sign, Figure 18) strongly suggests the diagnosis. Interstitial Pneumonia non-specific it has Been demonstrated that DTC, PH, lung disease induced by drugs and SARAH can produce a standard histological PINE. (87) However, it is still controversial if the PINE is a condition distinct from PIU. In addition, the inclusion of faveolamento from HRCT in the diagnostic algorithm obscures more still this distinction. Although the response to therapy and survival are better in PINE than in the MORE, recent studies have shown that the two diseases may have small differences in gene expression. (88) In other cases, PINE may display a genetic profile indistinguishable from that of PH. (89) The opacity of frosted glass-it is common in the PINE, and when accompanied by bronchiectasis traction or reticulation irregular, PINE reflects the way fibrotic disease (PINE mobile is very rare). At this point, given the diversity inherent to the conditions known to produce the pattern of PINE on HRCT and histopathology, caution is advisable when trying to predict the prognosis of a given patient. Ways chronic pneumonia in the organization Forms indolent (smoldering) and chronic PO, non-infectious, can produce clinical findings of dyspnea, progressive, low-grade fever, constitutional symptoms, and commits lung that does not respond to standard treatment for pneumonia infectious. Many conditions can result in PO. In a study conducted in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, involving 95 patients, the PO was idiopathic in one third of cases and secondary to a cause identifiable in the cases remaining. (90) The most common causes were: drugs (especially amiodarone and MTX), environmental exposure (such as observed in PH), aspiration, chronic, and DTC. Consolidations, central or peripheral, have been found in 64% of cases; opacity frosted glass, in 53%; and nodules in 26%. The biopsy transbrônquica was diagnostic in 58% of cases. In pneumonia in organization criptogênica (POC), typical patterns in the TC consist of consolidations parenchymal peripheral broncogramas air-and-glass opacities with the association varied. The consolidations in the POC suggest the diagnosis when distributions subpleurais and peribroncovasculares occur together or when the opacities are migratory. (91) The signal in the form of atoll or halo reverse (an opacity of frosted glass center surrounded by a rim or ring of consolidation) is found on the PO, but can also be seen in other conditions, such as PEC and paracoccidioidomicose. (92,93) In a study, a pattern perilobular abnormalities (opacities curvilineares that has greater thickness and, more important, the less definition than those found in septa interlobulares thickened, and with an appearance in the form of arcade or polygonal), which was observed in more than half of the patients. (94) The diagnosis of OP is based on a combination of clinical findings, histology, and image. (95) In the case of DTC, in the case of exposure to drugs or antigens to environmental, as well as in cases of aspiration, localized areas of the PO can be a find pathological secondary. Therefore, a diagnosis of PO should only be done in the presence of typical findings on HRCT, the absence of findings indicative of fibrosis on HRCT and a good response to corticosteroids. If these criteria are not met, the lung biopsy surgery should be performed. Interstitial Pneumonia acute interstitial pneumonia acute is typically characterized by the rapid development of dyspnea, progressive cough; in rare cases, respiratory symptoms lower can persist for up to 60 days. (96) interstitial lymphocytic Pneumonia To interstitial lymphocytic pneumonia is usually associated with Sjögren's syndrome in adults and HIV infection in children. (97) The findings of the most common in TC are opacity of frosted glass diffuse and consolidation; cysts thin-walled can also be present, presumably due to bronchiolitis follicular. The lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, first described by Liebow, is definitely represented by the lymphoma of lymphoid tissue associated to the mucous membrane of B cells from low-grade (known as MALToma) of the lung. It should be remembered that the increase of the lymphoid tissue that is dense on the lung is always considered as a lymphoma until proved otherwise. Patients with Sjögren's syndrome who present physiology obstructive, as well as cysts or nodules centrolobulares in HRCT, but which does not exhibit opacity of frosted glass, can be diagnosed with bronchiolitis follicular without the biopsy the open sky. In other cases, a surgical biopsy should be performed in order to discard-if lymphoma. (98) Lymphoma pulmonary Lymphoma, primary in the lungs are rare. One of the most common is MALToma, which is also known as "lymphoma B-cells of marginal zone extranodal". These lymphomas lung feature characteristically morphology indolent and low-grade and may be present in healthy individuals or in patients with Sjögren's syndrome Lymphomas of high-grade can also occur in the lung, although these tend to be more localized in the images and are much more easily diagnosed by histopathology. MALTomas of low degree can be difficult or impossible to be distinguished from hyperplasia benign lymphoid and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. Fortunately, the progression of the shape of the low grade of the disease is very slow. (99) Sarcoidosis In rare cases, sarcoidosis may present with opacity in frosted glass or consolidations. The frequency of opacity of frosted glass that is reported varies widely, and this finding is occasionally the abnormality is predominant. The opacity of frosted glass-is more typical of multifocal than diffuse. (100) The correlation of pathological opacity of frosted glass-in patients with sarcoidosis demonstrates that granulomas conglomerates can occur, as well as fibrosis of the delicate below the limits of resolution of HRCT. (101-103) Consolidations mimicking the OP are unusual in sarcoidosis. (104) The presentation is acute and the prognosis is excellent. Other findings of sarcoidosis and nodules military in the CT scan are also usually found. Pneumonia, eosinophilic chronic accumulation of significant eosinophils in the lungs is characteristic of the PEC. It has been suggested that a cell count differentials greater than 40% eosinophils in liquid LBA is diagnostic of PEC. (105) The symptoms are similar to those found in the POC (fever, weight loss, night sweats, cough and dyspnea), progressing in weeks or months. Asthma anticipates the diagnosis in 50% of cases. In a manner similar to POC, the consolidations can be migratory. In fact, the two diseases are difficult or impossible to be different in the HRCT,(106), and, in some cases, overlap in biopsies of the lungs. The diagnosis of PEC is based on a history of clinical manifestation insidious characteristic appearance in chest radiograph of infiltrated peripheral opacities, transient, and eosinophilia in the peripheral. In this scenario, the majority of authors does not recommend lung biopsy. The analysis of the LBA can be useful in cases without eosinophilia peripheral. Many conditions can result in lung diseases, eosinophilic rhinosinusitis. For a diagnosis of SGP, it is important to dispose of known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia: a history and examination careful to exclude systemic diseases (syndrome Churg-Strauss, sarcoidosis, etc. ), as well as a careful review of the consumption of medications concomitant to rule out pulmonary eosinophilia drug-induced. The examination of faeces for the identification of eggs and parasites is important. (105) it is Not uncommon for the incorrect diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia rather than the PEC. The clue key of PEC is a quick response and the dramatic use of oral corticosteroids. Pneumonia lipóide exogenous To microaspiração prolonged emulsions lipid can produce lung disease with a distinctive pattern on the HRCT scan, sometimes referred to as the standard crazy-paving: consolidation with attenuation low-and-glass opacities. The chronic form more common of the disease is caused by prolonged intake of laxatives based on mineral oil for the treatment of constipation. (107) The diagnosis is suggested by the finding of lipid-free or lipid in the vacuoles of the cells alveolar in the liquid of the LBA. If not confirmed, it becomes necessary to biopsy transbrônquica or surgical. In many cases, the cause is determined in retrospect, after the diagnosis has been established by lung biopsy surgical. Carcinoma bronquioloalveolar The definition of CBA is adenocarcinoma growth of cells neoplastic among the honeycomb structures (growth lepídico) without evidence of invasion of stromal, vascular or pleural. (108) There are three subtypes of CBA: non-cystadenocarcinoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and mixed. The pattern of pneumonia is more common in patients with type cystadenocarcinoma, and such patients are often diagnosed erroneously with pneumonia infectious. Findings radiographic such as glass opacities, consolidation, non-dissolving and nodules satellite centrolobulares due to the dissemination broncogênica should raise the suspicion of CBA. (109) Classically, CBA demonstrates a pattern of relatively slow growth and a clinical course indolent. However, in a subgroup of patients, rapid growth and death due to the disease consolidativa diffuse bilateral occurs months after the diagnosis. Patients with CBA diffuse advanced can present broncorréia and severe hypoxemia refractory to shunts intrapulmonares. (110) THE LBA usually reveals the presence of cells, cellular neoplastic well-differentiated, although this finding is not sufficient to distinguish CBA from a adenocarcinoma metastatic or invasive. (111) it Is important to distinguish between CBA and metastases of a tumor of the colon primary, that can mimic the appearance, histopathologic, and even the imunofenótipo CBA cystadenocarcinoma. (112) A core needle biopsy sample or a specimen surgical is necessary to distinguish CBA from other forms of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Proteinose alveolar pulmonary The accumulation of surfactant due to the low catabolism by macrophages alveolar leads to the development of PAP. This mainly occurs due to antibodies against the stimulating factor colony-macrophages granulocytes (GM-CSF), and the resulting lack of maturation/differentiation of the lineage of monocytes/macrophages. (113) The chest radiograph may reveal opacity of frosted glass-or consolidation, asymmetric, usually with a predominance of perihilar. The images of HRCT have the appearance of glass opacities in the airspace geographical thickening of the septa interlobulares resulting in the standard crazy-paving. However, this pattern is not specific for PAP and can be seen in the CBA cystadenocarcinoma, pneumonia lipóide exogenous, sarcoidosis, PINE, PO, pneumonia pneumocística and several other conditions diffuse acute. (114) However, when this standard is long and symmetrical in a patient with chronic symptoms, PAP, is highly suggested. The findings at LBA have a crucial role in the diagnosis of PAP (the classic effluent "milky" is considered diagnostic). In cases idiopathic, the determination of serum antibodies against GM-CSF (high levels indicate PAP) is a non-invasively confirm the diagnosis. (113) the Default 4. Opacity pulmonary decreased, Several abnormalities are associated with the mitigation of abnormally reduced. Faveolamento and bronchiectasis are important to differentiate attenuation abnormally reduced other abnormalities cystic. Emphysema is characterized by destruction of the lung that affects different portions of the lobe pulmonary secondary, and is classified into three distributions (Table 10; Figures 19, 20 and 21). Diseases cystic lung Diseases cystic primary are rare and should be differentiated from other more common that produce attenuation abnormal (low). Table 11 list the aspects and differential diagnosis of cysts of the lungs. Cysts of the lungs are lesions usually rounded, circumscribed and well defined with a thin wall (usually < 3 mm thick). (115) A frequent cause of pulmonary disorders cystic located is advanced fibrosis that leads to faveolamento. These cysts can have a diameter ranging from several millimeters to several centimeters. This wall is shared by cysts adjacent to, a finding not found in other diseases cystic lung. (115) Some diseases can mimic lung diseases, cystic on CT scan. The two potential causes of confusion, the most common are bronchiectasis and cystic emphysema (see below), although other conditions can be associated with cysts. Bronchiectasis cystic When diffuse bronchiectasis cystic can mimic lung disease cystic on HRCT. However, the differentiation between the two entities is usually possible when a branch of the pulmonary artery accompanying producing a signal in the form of a ring is viewed, as well as when, looking at the cuts adjacent to the TC and the images in another rebuilding phase, these show a character tubular abnormality. Emphysema In general, the emphysema has three main forms of presentation: centrolobular, in which multiple mitigations low centrolobulares, small and with or without walls occasionally visible predominate in areas of the upper lung (Figure 19). Emphysema paraseptal (Figure 20) may occasionally simulate changes in honeycomb lung. Changes enfisematosas paraseptais are often in a deep layer of the portion subpleural lung, whereas the change in honeycomb is typically viewed as a stacking of two or more layers of the cystic spaces small with thick walls along the periphery of the lung. In emphysema, centrolobular, there is rarely a wall in the cyst, and vessels can be viewed following the air spaces cystic, although there may be fibrosis in the spaces of emphysema centrolobular, with an aspect of the cyst, pulmonary resulting. Emphysema panlobular predominates in the lung bases. In emphysema, panlobular, there is a general reduction in attenuation in lung (Figure 21). Bronchiolitis respiratory-associated interstitial lung disease, The definition of BR-DPI is an interstitial lung disease related to smoking in which the cysts can be the result of bronchiolitis or emphysema centroacinar associated with it. The interpretation of HRCT can be more complicated when they are present emphysema, and BR-DPI on wolves upper and fibrosis in the lung bases, where faveolamento may also be present. In such cases, spirometry may be normal, but DLCO and gas exchange are severely compromised. (118) Langerhans cell Histiocytosis of The findings in the TC-HCL depend on the stage of the disease, and the ratio between the nodules and cysts. (119) Regardless of the stage of the disease, there is relative sparing of the lung bases compared with the upper parts. Initially, the findings on CT predominantly consisting of standard nodular lesions 1 to 10 mm of diameter, with jagged edges typical. Some nodules may exhibit cavitation (Figure 22). With the advancement of the disease, the cysts become the found predominant. In stage terminal disease, the cysts can be the only finding, with no lumps remaining. The combination of cysts and nodules, which preserve the lung bases, in men non-smokers, it is sufficient for a reliable diagnosis of HCL. (120) In smokers of the female sex, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) should be considered, since the nodules (and cysts) may also be present. (121) The cells of Langerhans can be identified in the liquid of the LBA, although the sensitivity and specificity of this test are very low. The definitive diagnosis of HCL requires the identification of lesions of Langerhans cells, which are usually obtained through lung biopsy at the site selected based on HRCT of the chest. In practice, however, the lung biopsy is performed in each case. (122) In biopsies of lung surgery, the presence of scars starry may be the only indication for the diagnosis. In this stage of the disease, the lesions contain few cells of Langerhans. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Patients presenting with an abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells atypical in the lungs, kidneys, lymph vessels, or in any combination of sites can be considered as candidates for the diagnosis of LAM. The disease can occur sporadically or associated with the complex of tuberous sclerosis. In both cases, LAM is seen only in adult women, generally featuring LAM after menopause. The gold standard for the diagnosis of LAM is a biopsy of lung tissue or of the lymphatic vessels involved, with infiltration nodular by smooth muscle cells abnormal, called the LAM cell. The analysis immunohisto-chemistry shows that these smooth muscle cells peculiar and distinct are positive for markers of melanoma HMB45 and MART-1, as well as for estrogen receptor/progesterone, actin muscle smooth and desmina. On HRCT, show multiple cysts of the thin walls scattered throughout the lung fields in irregular distribution, with areas of parenchyma normal lung (Figure 23). When the appearance of the lung is classic and the patient also exhibits other typical manifestations of LAM, is required a tissue biopsy for diagnosis. (122) In cases that require biopsy for diagnosis, lung biopsy surgical can show an extension extremely variable illness, ranging between cysts thin-walled cells and LAM in their walls (Figures 24 and 25) and bleeding chronic predominant that it may obscure the findings of the diagnostics. A proliferation of benign epithelial cells may also be present in patients with LAM who have the complex of tuberous sclerosis. Such injuries are known as "hyperplasia pneumocítica micronodular" and are not stained with the markers of LAM cell listed above. Neurofibromatosis type 1 In cases of neurofibromatosis type 1, HRCT reveals-glass opacities, opacities reticular bibasais, bulls and cysts, as well as emphysema, in the lobes the upper. (123) Other lung diseases, interstitial with cysts Cysts can occur in various DIPDs, including PH, chronic sarcoidosis, chronic, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, PID and BR-DPI. (120,124,125) In a study of diagnostic accuracy by HRCT in lung diseases cystic chronic,(120) a reliable diagnosis was obtained by two radiologists in approximately half of the cases. (126) in That study, the diagnosis was correct in approximately 90% of the cases in which the diagnosis was PID/BR-DPI, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, LAM, and HCL, and in 100% of cases of PIU. Perfusion in the mosaic (Figure 18) represents the regions of attenuation in lung decreased due to a reduction in blood flow. This can be the result of diseases bronquiolares or vascular. When the lung appears heterogeneous, it is important to discern which regions are abnormal: attenuation low or high. The density in the lungs is usually a factor of confusion when trying to differentiate perfusion in the mosaic (attenuation low) opacity of frosted glass (high attenuation). Table 12 displays the useful aspects of this differentiation. Perfusion in the mosaic can be seen in any disease bronquiolar or vascular and, therefore, the differential is very broad. When this phenomenon is the result of vascular disease, the findings on HRCT mimic those seen in patients with the disease infiltrativa in the scanning of the inspiration; however, in the scanning of the expiration, trapping air should not be an aspect dominant in vascular disease. Unfortunately, the vascular disease can be difficult to be correctly identified by HRCT and can easily be confused with lung disease infiltrativa or disease of the airways. (127) Evidence of functional airway obstruction or residual volume high can be useful in such cases. Trapping air is a sign indirect disease obstructive small airways and can be identified by the presence of attenuation in the mosaic in the TC inspiratory, which is accented with images expiratórias. Although the entrapment of air is easily detected when focal because it produces attenuation in the mosaic, can be difficult to detect it when diffuse. As the trapped air usually becomes apparent only in images expiratórias, scanning the expiratory is an essential part of the assessment of bronchiolitis CT. However, the interpretation of the CT expiratory is complicated by the knowledge that the prevalence of trapping air in healthy individuals can be substantial. The finding of the entrapment of air in the TC should be ignored in the absence of evidence of physiological of the residual volume is high (by plethysmography), airway obstruction or dyspnea. (128) If the perfusion in the mosaic is displayed in the absence of any other abnormalities (for ex., bronchiectasis, pattern, tree budding, and other signs of emboli chronic pulmonary), the differential diagnosis is more focused and includes the diseases listed below. Asthma and bronchiolitis chronic Non-smokers with obstruction persistent in the airways and a diagnosis of asthma or COPD can have bronchiolitis chronic associated. In the absence of eosinophils increased in the sputum and the lack of response to standard treatments for asthma, such patients should be evaluated with HRCT expiratory. Those with trapping air significant should be considered for lung biopsy surgery for a better identification of the underlying disease. (129) With the exception observed in transplant patients, the most common forms of bronchiolitis resulting in attenuation in the mosaic isolated on DIDP in clinical are the following: (a) disorders of the connective tissue (especially, rheumatoid arthritis) b) viral infections or mycoplasma prior (c) PH chronic d) bronchiolitis constrictive criptogênica and hyperplasia of cells of neuroendocrine lung Bronchiolitis constrictive defined as bronchiolitis constrictive criptogênica the permanent damage to the small airways, with no cause identifiable. (130) This disorder is rare and occurs mainly in women. The bronchiolitis constrictive criptogênica tends to be progressive, and little responds to corticosteroid therapy but may respond to immunosuppressive agents. The limitation phase-flow air can result in respiratory failure and death. The pathology is generally discrete and usually based on the recognition of the loss bronquiolar (which may be difficult to quantify), typically accompanied by bronchioles dilated with thin walls and sparse in addition to stasis mucoid in the lumens of airways. Pneumonitis hypersensitivity Patients with PH may present with a pattern isolated in the mosaic due to the disease sub-acute (bronchiolitis cellular with cells giant or granulomas) or chronic, with bronchiolitis fibrotic. (16,131) The possibility of environmental exposure should be carefully investigated. Hyperplasia of cells of neuroendocrine lung diffuse hyperplasia of cells of neuroendocrine lung diffuse is a very rare condition, and little known, characterized by perfusion in the mosaic due to the entrapment of air, thickening of the wall of the airway and nodules small occasional on HRCT. (132) The number of cells neuroendocrine is increased around the small airways, and between your epithelium. The disease primarily affects middle-aged women and manifests itself as an obstruction of the airways unexplained (because the disease affects typically non-smokers). Correlations clinical and pathological perfusion in the mosaic can be seen in any disease bronquiolares or vascular diseases, and differential diagnosis is therefore very broad. In some cases, it is difficult to differentiate such diseases of disease infiltrativa. However, based on the differential aspects listed in Table 12, a reliable diagnosis can usually be reached. The entrapment of air from the TC expiratory, which is not seen in vascular disease, can confirm the diagnosis of disease of the airways. (133) Evidence of functional obstruction to the flow of air or residual volume high can be very useful in difficult cases. The bronchiolitis is a common finding in patients with bronchiectasis by any causes. (134) As a find microscopic isolated, is etiologicamente nonspecific and must be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation, and aspects of radiographic. In other words, disease processes clinically distinct can display patterns histologically overlapping of bronchiolitis in Spite of the findings morphologically nonspecific, in many cases, certain forms of bronchiolitis are histologically distinct; these tend to occur in clinical contexts, characteristic. Lesions such as bronchiolitis constrictive and panbronquiolite diffuse are examples. However, even these patterns are microscopic do not have diagnostic significance unless correlated with clinical aspects and radiographic. (135) the Sign for "headcheese" or "terrine" The combination of opacity of frosted glass-and perfusion in the mosaic in the same patient is called signal headcheese or terrine (Table 13; Figures 26 and 27). This gives the lung an appearance heterogeneous with three densities of the lung: high attenuation (opacity frosted glass); normal; and attenuation (low perfusion in the mosaic). Since it is typically because of PH, this finding is very useful. (136) final Considerations since HRCT is the imaging technique radiation which more closely reflects the changes in the structure of the lung, this is the method of choice for the study the diagnosis of patients with DIPD or suspected of DIPD. Although a finding only on the HRCT scan is often nonspecific, the combination of several findings, combined with his distribution of anatomical can suggest the diagnosis more likely.
