SUMMARY bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and mixed adenocarcinomas with bronchioloalveolar component are varied and multiple standards for image presentations. The purpose of this essay is to describe and illustrate the most characteristic findings of these tumors in CT. three performances are described: solitary pulmonary nodule, consolidation and diffuse presentation, and the last two are important in the differential diagnosis of infectious involvement. Knowledge of the various presentations and the use of appropriate diagnostic procedures are definitive for the early diagnosis and improved survival. Keywords: lung neoplasms; bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma; Computed tomography by X-ray     Introduction adenocarcinomas are the most common histological type of cancer in many countries, with wide spectrum of clinical characteristics, molecular and pathological, as well as image. The bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a subtype of adenocarcinoma, with cellular spread (lepídica) in interstitial substrate intact and no vascular invasion, stromal or pleural. These tumors can be divided into three types: non-mucinous (clear cell subtype / type II pneumocytes); mucinous; and mixed (mucinous and non-mucinous). Usually, the CBA not mucinous tends to present as a solitary lesion and has a better prognosis, while the mucinous subtype often presents with consolidation, with a propensity to spread and poor survival.(1.2) before the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification for pulmonary neoplasms, all tumors were considered lepidic growth CBA, and this subtype prevalence reached 24% of all lung tumors.(3) After the new WHO criteria for the diagnosis of CBA, its prevalence has proved to be less than 5% of lung malignancies (4); most cases is now considered mixed adenocarcinomas with bronchioloalveolar component (AM-CBA).(1.4) The main characteristics of CBA and AM-CBA are peripheral location, desmoplastic reaction, mucin production, high frequency in non-smokers, more often in women, low tendency to spread lymph node / extrathoracic and propensity to multifocality.(2,5,6) Symptoms include coughing (35%), mucoid expectoration (24%), dyspnea (15%), weight loss (13%), hemoptysis (11%) and fever (8%).(7) The bronchorrhea is known to be a characteristic of the tumor; however, this is unusual and appears in the advanced stages of the disease.(7) The survival rates for localized CBA to 100% in five years.(8) The prognosis is most favorable for CBA CBA and AM-located with greater component-glass ( > 50%) when compared to that in the TC of predominantly solid tumors.(3.5) There is evidence demonstrating lower cell doubling time of lung cancer in smokers, demonstrating more aggressive lesion. This fact, combined with poor cardiopulmonary function of many of these patients would explain the poor prognosis of lung cancer in smokers.(2.9) Surgical biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis; when the procedure is contraindicated, the histological diagnosis can be made by percutaneous biopsy or transbronchial associated with compatible CT findings.(5) are recognized three main CBA standards in CT: pulmonary solitary nodule or mass; consolidation; and multifocal disease.(2,3,10) According to the new WHO classification, most cases correspond to AM-CBA, and pure CBA appears as focal ground-glass opacity on CT without architectural distortion.(4) Advances in the understanding of the molecular aspects and radiologic-pathologic correlation led to a new proposal for classification of adenocarcinomas, aiming to standardize the terminology and diagnostic criteria.(11) Although there is a need for universally accepted criteria for adenocarcinoma subtypes, the authors of the new classification proposal understand that there will be a period of adaptation to the suggested terms and initially recommend the use of the above terms accompanied by the current nomenclature.(11) The objective of this test is to describe the tomographic patterns and AM-CBA CBA through a series of illustrative cases.   image patterns in the CBA and AM-CBA pulmonary nodule and focal ground-glass opacities The solitary pulmonary nodule, usually on the periphery of the upper lobes, is described as the most common tomographic manifestation of the CBA and AM-CBA.(12) Most of these nodules are semi-solid, with solid components and frosted glass, displaying irregular margins and pleural indentation.(7) Although the excavation is rare at initial presentation, some nodes may have focal lucências known as pseudocavidades (Figure 1).(7.13) may be excavating after chemotherapy (Figure 2).     Ground-glass opacities admit multiple differential diagnoses, ranging from benign diseases such as focal fibrosis and infectious nature injuries; premalignant opacities, such as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (HAA); to malignant lesions such as CBA and AM-CBA.(14) The current WHO classification for lung tumors include the HAA as a premalignant lesion, the CBA precursor with its own morphological and molecular characteristics, the most common tomographic manifestation is pulmonary nodules with ground-glass attenuation.(1) Nakata et al. They studied tomographic characteristics that could help in the differential diagnosis of CBA and HAA, describing that HAA is generally < 1.0 cm and is presented as purely opacities in frosted glass, while CBA has at least 1.0 cm and can show solid components.(15) In daily practice, the following focal ground-glass opacities is crucial. Most benign lesions tend to reduce or disappear in three months; premalignant and malignant lesions may remain unchanged or increase (Figure 3).(16) positron emission tomography (PET, positron emission proton) is considered as a fundamental tool in staging, treatment and follow-up lung cancer (Figure 4). However, it should be emphasized that the pure CBA can not demonstrate hyper 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), (6) since these tumors are usually indolent, slow and well differentiated growth. Therefore, the absence of FDG uptake does not exclude the possibility of cancer, such as CBA, minor injuries or indolent tumors. Martins et al.(17) studied the diagnostic accuracy of PET in the evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules and, among the 32 patients studied, only obtained a false-negative result, the final diagnosis was CBA. Thus, the analysis of the tomographic imaging is mandatory for diagnosis (Figure 5). Consolidation consolidation pattern corresponds to 30% of cases of CBA, being more frequent in mucinous variant.(3) This pattern is also described as pneumonic variant of the CBA.(18) Given the difficulty to distinguish this pattern of CBA that infectious pneumonias, there is often a delay in diagnosis. Some findings, such as angiogram sign, air bronchograms, ground-glass opacities and air-space nodules (Figure 6) can be observed both in the CBA, as in lobar pneumonia.(3.19) Lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion may also be present in both entities.(16) parenchymal consolidation that does not resolve after treatment should raise the possibility of lung cancer.(2,3,18) The angiogram sign can be seen on CT with contrast, consisting of pulmonary vessels that branch through the consolidation of low attenuation (Figure 7), usually corresponding to air spaces filled with mucin. First described as specific for pneumonic variant of CBA, this signal can be seen in several entities, such as infectious pneumonia, pulmonary edema, post-obstructive pneumonia, lymphoma and metastases.(19) The PET may be useful for the evaluation of suspected parenchymal consolidations for malignancy (Figure 8) or to the characterization of the lesion or staging of neoplastic consolidation. However, it should be noted that some cases of CBA or AM-CBA can not capture the labeled glucose (false negatives) and inflammatory and / or infectious processes can be false-positive in PET scanners.(5) Presentation diffuse Diffuse involvement of the CBA can represent multifocal origin, endobronchial spread, hematogenous metastases or combinations of these patterns. Consolidation, nodules (Figure 9), ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms and cysts (Figure 10) and peripheral distribution and lower lobes, characterize this standard.(20) satellites pulmonary lesions can be seen both in the CBA, and in pneumonia.(18) Ground-glass opacities associated with septal thickening ( "crazy-paving") are also described in diffuse presentation of the CBA (Figure 11). The differential diagnosis should be made with other benign conditions such as alveolar proteinosis (18) bleeding and infection. The study PET can be used to evaluate patients with diffuse pattern CBA, especially for staging and posttreatment follow-up (Figure 12). It should be remembered that some cases can not capture the labeled glucose, highlighting the importance of a careful analysis of CT for differential diagnosis and staging.   Final considerations CBA and AM-CBA have wide variety of tomographic patterns, as solitary lump or mass, ground-glass opacities, consolidation and diffuse presentation. Knowledge of the main imaging findings of these neoplasms is of paramount importance, especially for the early diagnosis and differentiation of such tumors of lung infections. focal opacities and / or parenchymal consolidations slow resolution or no significant change after treatment should raise the suspicion of neoplasia type CBA or CBA-AM; in such situations, it is recommended to continue the diagnostic investigation to rule out lung cancer. PET can be used in the differential diagnosis or in tumor staging; it is noteworthy, however, that the method may be false-negative and false-positive, and one should always perform a careful analysis of tomographic findings.
