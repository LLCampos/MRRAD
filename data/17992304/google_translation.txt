Risk factors.     INTRODUCTION Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), either asymptomatic or symptomatic, it is characterized by a gradual reduction in blood flow due to an occlusive process in the arterial beds of the lower limbs [1-4]. In most cases, the cause is atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic phenomena, but may also reflect the influence of other diseases such as arteritis, aneurysm and embolism [1-4]. Intermittent claudication, or burning pain or cramping in the calf or buttocks after physical activity, is the most common clinical manifestation of PAD [1,3,4]. Its diagnostic strategy, however, should also include detailed physical examination, investigation of clinical signs such as absence of peripheral pulses, arterial tremors and skin changes in the affected limb, as well as confirmation of the severity of vascular obstruction, determined by the ankle-brachial index (ABI) - which expresses the relationship between systolic blood pressure on the posterior tibial artery compared to systolic pressure in the brachial artery [3]. The risk factors for PAD are similar to those associated with coronary artery disease include advanced age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity and hypertension [1,5]. The prevalence of PAOD in the general population, in individuals over 55 years is 19.1% [6]; while in patients over 65 years is 19.8% and 16.8%, respectively, in men and women [7]. Given the frequent coexistence of atherosclerotic processes in different vascular territories, previous studies have shown that the ABI presents a strong correlation with the presence and severity of atherosclerosis in the carotid and coronary arteries [1,8,9]. In middle-aged and older adults a reduced ABI is associated with increased mortality and increased risk of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease [1,10]. Studies correlating ABI, PAOD and coronary risk factors in patients undergoing coronary angiography, were, however, little explored in recent medical literature. The objectives of this study are to assess the prevalence of PAD in patients undergoing coronary angiography; in addition to analyzing the relationship between ABI and coronary artery disease, and its correlation with cardiovascular risk factors.   METHOD Population After being informed about the research, agreed to participate and signed a free and informed consent, participated initially in this study 130 patients undergoing coronary angiography in coronary care unit of Hospital Santa Lucinda - Annex 3 to the Hospital Complex of Sorocaba, during the from June 2005 to May 2006. There were, however, excluded from the initial sample, 17 patients who had higher ABI value to 1.3; leaving, thus, effectively 113 patients included in the study sample and statistical analysis. The age of participants ranged from 35 to 82 years, with a mean of 65.91 ± 13.44 years. As to gender, 53.10% (60) were male and 46.90% (53) female. Method The design is an observational and cross-sectional study - type survey. Prior to catheterization, we performed the ABI measurement, using a Doppler ultrasound device (Doppler Vascular; DV610; Medmega, Brazil), and were investigated cardiovascular risk factors, from specifically prepared script, that included age (years), sex, smoking, alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. After the coronary angiography, patients were divided initially into two groups - patients without coronary artery disease and patients with coronary artery disease. Subsequently, the patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of coronary disease: Group 1 - absence of coronary lesions; Group 2 - mild to moderate obstructive disease (when the stenosis was less than 70% in at least one major coronary artery _ right or left coronary artery and its branches, anterior descending artery and circumflex artery); and Group 3 - severe obstructive disease (when the injury took 70% or more of the arterial diameter, to say the least, one of the main coronary arteries: right or left coronary artery and its branches, anterior descending artery and circumflex artery). Patients whose coronary angiography results showed parietal irregularities or diffuse calcifications atheromatosis, at least one of the aforementioned coronary arteries were included in group 2. In addition, ABI values ​​above 1.3 represented the only exclusion criterion of patients in this study, as they are associated with diffuse disease of the vessels with calcification of the middle layer and vascular wall rigidity, which makes the arteries non- compressible during inflation of the cuff. [3] This phenomenon, which occurs more frequently in high cardiovascular risk groups, such as diabetics, the elderly and patients with chronic kidney failure, affects the value and clinical significance of the ABI [3]. Patients, therefore, who had ABI > 1.3 were excluded from this study. This research was approved by the Commission for Teaching and Research Site. Cardiovascular risk factors Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) / height (m) 2. Obesity was defined as BMI above 30 kg / m2. Smoking was determined, according to the classification of patients in smokers at the time of the interview (at least 10 cigarettes / day) and non-smokers (including ex-smokers for at least two years ago, and never smokers). The alcohol consumption was defined as alcoholics at the time of the interview (regardless of the amount consumed) and non-alcoholic (including former consumers for at least a year without drinking). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg, or current use of antihypertensive medications for blood pressure control. Diabetes mellitus was considered present when there was a previous diagnosis of diabetes or when the patient reported taking insulin or hypoglycemic agents, or when the fasting plasma glucose equal to or greater than 126 mg / dL in the absence of prior diagnosis. They were not included as variables of the study, total cholesterol and fractions and triglycerides, the difficulty in obtaining the laboratory dosages. ABI The ABI is a simple, cost-effective and non-invasive for early detection of PAOD which complements the assessment of cardiovascular risk. This examination has been recommended in clinical practice, in order to measure the patency of the arterial circulation of the lower limbs. The researchers of this study were specifically trained to perform the ABI measurement under standard conditions. The measurements were performed after the patient rest 5 minutes in the supine position. Systolic blood pressures were measured in the following order: the right brachial artery; posterior tibial artery and right dorsalis pedis; posterior tibial artery and left dorsalis pedis; and the left brachial artery. The ABI was calculated as the ratio between the highest of the two systolic (posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis) below the ankle with the greatest pressure of the brachial portion. The pressures of both legs were measured and the ABI was calculated for each leg. In the case of absence of the ABI in one leg (amputation) or brachial systolic pressure in one arm, the value of the contralateral limbs were used. Likewise, in the absence of the blood pressure value in one of the legs (tibial and dorsalis pedis), the value of the other leg was used for the calculation of ABI. PAD was defined as ABI < 0.90. The lowest ABI between the two legs was used as a reference for data analysis. Patients, therefore, are divided into two groups according to the ABI: ABI > 0.90 and ABI < 0.90. Statistical analysis was used SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), in its version 13.0, to obtain the results. Parametric variables were presented as means ± standard deviation. Analyzing the sample divided into two groups, the absence and presence of coronary lesions, the Mann-Whitney test was applied. Comparing the patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of coronary involvement, we were first used the Kruskal-Wallis test and then the variables that showed statistical significance were analyzed on a par with the Mann-Whitney test. The Spearman correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between cardiovascular risk factors and the value of the ABI, for the presence of coronary artery lesions. The logistic regression analysis that included the statistically significant variables in Spearman correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the probability of coronary lesions, based on the ABI and cardiovascular risk factors included in the study. Analyzing the group with ABI > 0.90 and the group with ABI < 0.90, Mann-Whitney test was applied. For non-parametric variables were calculated the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI), both in relation to PAOD and in relation to coronary artery disease. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.   RESULTS Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of patients with and without coronary artery disease. Of the 113 patients included in the statistical analysis, 53.10% were male and 46.90% female. The mean age and the mean BMI was 65.91 ± 13.44 years and 30.09 ± 4.39 kg / m2, respectively. In addition, 47.79% are smokers, 61.95% are diabetic, 66.37% are hypertensive and 15.04% are alcoholics. The average systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were, respectively, 149.09 ± 22.44 mmHg, 92.84 ± 11.84 mmHg and 56.16 ± 14.57 mmHg. There was a significant difference in age (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), BMI (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001 ) and pulse pressure (p < 0.001) among those who had and those who did not have coronary artery lesions. There was no significant difference in gender (p = 0.186) and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.145). The mean value of ABI was 0.83 ± 0.18 in the total sample, 0.98 ± 0.08 in patients without coronary disease and 0.71 ± 0.14 in patients with coronary artery disease. There was a significant difference between the latter two groups (p < 0.001). Patients with coronary artery disease had more advanced age than those without coronary artery disease (73.08 ± 10.15 vs. 56.21 ± 11.09 years); plus a predominance of males (58.46% vs. 45.83%); greater proportion of smokers (69.23% vs. 18.75%), hypertension (84.62% vs. 41.67%) and diabetes (67.69% vs. 54.17%); highest average BMI (32.35 ± 2.67 vs. 27.02 ± 4.42), systolic blood pressure (160.34 ± 21.11 vs. 133.85 ± 13.45), diastolic blood pressure (98, 34 ± 11.12 vs. 85.40 ± 8.21) and pulse pressure (62.00 ± 15.78 vs. 48.25 ± 7.48); and lower average value of ABI (0.71 ± 0.14 vs. 0.98 ± 0:08). Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of patients divided into three groups according to the severity of coronary artery disease. As to age, the average age of the group 1 was 56.21 ± 11.09 years; the group 2 was 66.67 ± 7.00 years; and the third group was 77.63 ± 9.61 years. Regarding sex, group 1 consisted of 45.83% men and 54.17% women; group 2, by 48.15% men and 51.85% women; and group 3, by 65.79% men and 34.21% women. The age group (p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.030), systemic arterial hypertension (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), BMI (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) and pulse pressure (p < 0.001) showed statistically significant differences when the three groups were analyzed concurrently. In addition, the average value of ABI was 0.98 ± 0.08 in group 1 patients, 0.80 ± 0.12 in group 2, and 0.65 ± 0.11 in group 3 . There was a significant difference between the three groups as to the ABI (p < 0.001). Analyzing the three groups of patients when combined pairwise (Group 1 versus Group 2, Group 1 x Group 3 and Group 2 versus Group 3), we observed that the patients in the three groups differed significantly from each other, as to the age, BMI , systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure and ABI. There was no significant difference between groups 2 and 3 to smoking and hypertension; while there was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. Table 3 shows the risk factors and comorbidity associated with coronary artery disease, based on the calculation of the odds ratio. We observed in this analysis that age (OR: 3.750; CI: 1.377 to 10.209, p = 0.010), hypertension (OR: 4.900; CI: 1.675 to 14.336, p = 0.004), smoking (OR: 6.303; CI: 2.193 to 18.116, p = 0.001) and BMI (OR: 19.341; CI: 5.502 to 67.991; p < 0.001) were strongly associated with coronary lesion < 70%; while ABI > 0.90 (OR: 0.026; CI: 0.007 to 0.101; p < 0.001) was not associated with coronary lesion < 70%, constituting therefore a protective factor for this type of injury. Similarly, age (OR: 25.500; CI: 7.492 to 86.790; p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR: 3.173; CI: 1.209 to 8.326; p = 0.019), hypertension (OR: 11.900; CI: 3.641 to 38.895; p < 0.001), smoking (OR: 13.963; CI: 4.928 to 39.562; p < 0.001) and BMI (OR: 60.545; CI: 12.534 to 292.466; p < 0.001) were strongly associated with coronary lesions > 70 %; while ITB ³0,90 (OR: 0.003; CI: 0.000 to 0.028; p < 0.001) was not associated with coronary lesions > 70%, also constituting a protective factor for severe coronary artery disease. For the analysis of Spearman correlation, age (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), BMI (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), pulse pressure (p < 0.001) and ABI (p < 0.001) were directly correlated to the presence of coronary lesions. There was no significant correlation between gender (p = 0.187) and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.146) and coronary lesion. By logistic regression analysis, we found that patients with ABI < 0.90, BMI > 30 kg / m2 and age > 60 years had the highest probability of coronary lesions (98.93%); while patients with ABI > 0.90, BMI < 30 kg / m2 and age < 60 years had the lowest probability of coronary lesions (1.33%). Already patients with ABI > 0.90, BMI > 30 kg / m2 and age > 60 years presented a possibility of coronary artery lesions of 53.71%; while patients with ABI < 0.90, BMI < 30 kg / m2 and age < 60 years presented a possibility of coronary artery lesions of 51.86%. Table 4 shows the clinical characteristics of patients with and without PAOD, divided according to the ABI. Of the 113 patients included in the study, 56.60% (64) had PAD (ABI < 0.90), with 90.76% (59) of patients with coronary artery disease had concomitant PAOD. The prevalence of PAD was higher in males (57.80%) than in women (42.20%). Patients with PAD were more advanced age than those without PAOD (72.34 ± 11.40 vs. 57.51 ± 11.11 years); plus a predominance of males (57.80% vs. 46.90%); greater proportion of smokers (68.75% vs. 20.41%), hypertension (85.94% vs. 40.82%) and diabetes (68.75% vs. 53.06%); highest average BMI (32.13 ± 2.99 vs. 27.42 ± 4.53), systolic blood pressure (161.33 ± 20.42 vs. 133.10 ± 12.93), diastolic blood pressure (98, 73 ± 10.97 vs. 85.14 ± 7.89) and pulse pressure (62.59 ± 15.32 vs. 47.76 ± 7.74); and lower average value of ABI (0.70 ± 0.11 vs. 0.98 ± 0.01). There was a significant difference in age (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), BMI (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001 ) and pulse pressure (p < 0.001) between individuals with and without PAOD. There was no significant difference in gender (p = 0.253) and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.090). Table 5 shows the risk factors and comorbidities associated with PAOD, based on the calculation of the odds ratio (OR). We observed in this analysis, that diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.76, CI: 1.53 to 2.02; p < 0.001), hypertension (OR: 1.06, CI: 1.05 to 1.07 ; p < 0.001) and smoking (OR: 1.17, CI: 1.04 to 1.19; p < 0.001) were strongly associated with PAD; while BMI < 30 kg / m2 (OR: 0.08, CI: 0.03 to 0.20; p < 0.001) was not associated with PAOD, and thus is a protective factor for PAD.     DISCUSSION Patients undergoing coronary angiography present per se an increased cardiovascular risk, since they have significant percentages of risk factors for atherosclerotic phenomena in coronary arterial myocardial infarction beds, such as older age, male gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity [11]. Among the 65 coronary patients in this study, we found patients with higher age group; greater proportion of smoking, hypertension and diabetes; higher average value of systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure, when compared to patients without coronary artery disease. In addition, the Spearman correlation analysis, age, hypertension, smoking, BMI, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure were strongly associated with the presence of coronary artery lesions. Our results agree with the data observed by Iglézias et al. [11] Brevetti et al. [12], demonstrating the strong influence of cardiovascular risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic phenomena and coronary atherothrombotic. Furthermore, Session et al. [13] reported that in patients under 60 years, systolic and diastolic pressures are important predictors of cardiovascular risk, whereas in individuals over 60 years, only the systolic and pulse pressure were associated with this risk. We have performed well in this study, an analysis of the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and the severity of coronary artery disease. Our results showed a significant difference for age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and BMI, with the degree of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, we find that the severity of coronary artery disease is directly associated with older age groups and higher mean BMI, systolic, diastolic and pulse. Based on the calculation of the odds ratio, age, hypertension, smoking and BMI were strongly associated with the presence of both mild coronary lesion to moderate (lesion < 70%) and severe coronary artery lesions ( > 70%), highlighting, again, the impact of cardiovascular risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic processes in coronary arterial beds. As for the ABI, we found in this study a significantly lower average value of ABI in patients with coronary artery disease compared to individuals without coronary artery disease (p < 0.001). In addition, based on the calculation of the odds ratio, an ABI > 0.90 constituted a protective factor for both coronary lesion mild to moderate (lesions < 70%) and severe coronary artery impairment (lesions > 70%). These results agree with the findings of other researchers, suggesting a strong inverse relationship between ABI and coronary artery disease [8,14-16]. We also found in this study, from the logistic regression analysis, that older, obese patients and decreased ABI ( < 0.90), showed a probability of coronary artery lesions of 98.93%; while young patients, not obese and with normal ABI ( > 0.90) had a probability of coronary lesion of 1.33%. In addition, young patients, not obese, but with reduced ABI ( < 0.90) had a risk of coronary artery lesions of 51.86%. These results point to a reduced ABI as a possible marker of coronary atherosclerosis and a predictor, either independently or in association with other cardiovascular risk factors, again suggesting a strong inverse relationship between ABI and presence of coronary lesions. According to our results, highlights the importance of considering a reduced ABI, as a risk factor for patients with symptoms consistent with coronary artery disease. Based on the direct relationship between the severity of coronary artery disease and the reduction of the ABI demonstrated in this study, cardiovascular surgeons should be aware of the importance of ABI measurement in the clinical evaluation of patients at risk for coronary artery disease, as well as their participation as an indispensable tool to decide on the need for a possible surgical procedure of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with severe coronary lesions. The AAI, as marker of asymptomatic PAOD, provides important information about subclinical atherosclerosis, in addition to being an important predictor of cardiovascular events [17]. An ABI < 0.90 shows 90% sensitivity 97% and specificity of 98% to 100% for the detection of arterial stenosis that compromises 50% or more of light from one or more major vessels of the lower extremities [ 3]. In this research, 56.60% of patients had PAD, which is more prevalent in males (57.80%) than in women (42.20%). In addition, 90.76% of patients had concomitant coronary artery disease PAOD, ratifying the systemic nature of the atherosclerotic phenomena. The prevalence of PAOD, our results surpass the 25.4% found by Hasimu et al. [18]; while regarding the presence of PAD in patients with coronary artery disease, our data are lower than the 98% reported by Sukhija et al. [19]. Lu et al. [20] in a study on smoking and peripheral arterial disease, identified smoking as a major risk factor not only for coronary artery disease, but for PAOD. The results of this study agree with the literature, since the prevalence of smoking was greater in individuals with coronary heart disease (69.23%), and in patients with PAOD (68.75%). Smoking also showed a direct association with the severity of coronary artery disease, and it seems to increase by 1.17 the risk of developing PAD. From the results above, shows the influence of this risk factor in the development of atherosclerotic and atherothrombotic phenomena widespread, both in coronary arterial beds and in peripheral [18,21]. Cordova et al. . [22], assessing the beneficial cardiovascular properties of wine, affirmed that consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol (20 to 30g / day) is a protective factor for coronary artery disease, reducing by 40% the risk for coronary artery disease. In this study, the prevalence of alcoholism was high both in patients without coronary artery disease (16.67%) and in individuals without PAOD (20.41%), proving to be a possible factor independent protective, but not significant, PAOD and disease coronary, as previously observed by Meijer et al. [23]. According to the Framingham study [24], systemic hypertension increases the risk of PAOD by 2.5% in men and 3.9% in women, and the pulse pressure is a more powerful predictor of cardiovascular events than systolic or diastolic pressure alone. In our study, the impact of hypertension on the development of atherothrombotic phenomena was observed both in the coronary arteries and in peripheral arterial beds, since a high percentage of hypertensive patients had coronary artery disease (84.62%) and PAD (85, 94%). Hypertension also showed a direct relationship with the severity of coronary artery disease, and it seems to increase by 1.06 the risk of PAOD. It was also observed in this study, a significant difference with respect to the systolic, diastolic and pulse, not only among patients with coronary artery disease, but also among individuals with PAOD. Regarding systolic blood pressure and pulse, our results agree with those of Hasimu et al. [18], strengthening the role of these risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic processes in different vascular territories, as well as confirming the concurrence between both risk factors for coronary artery disease and PAOD. Murabito et al. [25] evaluated the prevalence and clinical correlates of peripheral arterial disease, identified diabetes as an important risk factor not only for coronary artery disease, but for PAOD, asymptomatic and symptomatic, and say that the prevalence of diabetes diabetes increases in patients with reduced ABI. The results of this study agree with the literature, since the prevalence of diabetes was greater in individuals with coronary artery disease (67.69%), and in patients with PAOD (68.65%). Diabetes mellitus also showed a direct association with the severity of coronary artery disease, and it seems to increase by 1.76 the risk of PAOD. Our results demonstrate the influence of diabetes mellitus on the development of atherosclerotic phenomena, both in coronary arterial beds and in peripheral [18,21,23]. The above data highlights the need to value a reduced ABI, whatever the degree of reduction of this index as an important risk factor in individuals with symptoms consistent with coronary heart disease, in addition to providing an important severity parameter coronary involvement. the presence of two comorbidities, PAOD and coronary artery disease is noticed, that influence negatively expressively by their interrelationships, contributing dramatically to the development of ischemic heart disease and the need for surgical treatment with revascularization myocardium.   CONCLUSION The study suggests that a reduced ABI ( < 0.90) is a marker of coronary artery disease in patients at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Due to the high concordance between PAD and coronary artery disease in this study (90.76%), stresses the importance of determining the ABI as an indispensable tool in clinical assessment protocol for patients at risk for coronary disease. In addition, an ABI > 0.90 constituted a protective factor for both moderate coronary lesion and severe coronary artery lesion. It is suggested also that risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, are adequately treated and that obesity and smoking are strongly discouraged.   Acknowledgments To Mr. Euro Barros Couto Junior, for the statistical analysis and Ms. Isabel Cristina Campos Feitosa, the literature review.
