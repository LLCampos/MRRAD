Peripheral vascular diseases. Risk factors. INTRODUCTION: The peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), either asymptomatic or symptomatic, is characterized by a gradual reduction of the blood flow due to an occlusive process in the arterial beds of the lower limbs [1-4]. In most cases, the cause is atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic phenomena, but may also reflect the influence of other diseases such as arteritis, aneurysm and embolism [1-4]. Intermittent claudication, or burning pain or cramping in the calf or buttocks after physical activity, is the most common clinical manifestation of PAD [1,3,4]. Its diagnostic strategy, however, should also include detailed physical examination, investigation of clinical signs such as absence of peripheral pulses, arterial tremors and skin changes in the affected limb, as well as confirmation of the severity of vascular obstruction, determined by the ankle-brachial index (ABI) - which expresses the relationship between systolic blood pressure on the posterior tibial artery compared to systolic pressure in the brachial artery [3]. The risk factors for PAD are similar to those associated with coronary artery disease include advanced age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity and hypertension [1,5]. The prevalence of PAOD in the general population, in individuals over 55 years is 19.1% [6]; while in patients over 65 years is 19.8% and 16.8%, respectively, in men and women [7]. Given the frequent coexistence of atherosclerotic processes in different vascular territories, previous studies have shown that the ABI presents a strong correlation with the presence and severity of atherosclerosis in the carotid and coronary arteries [1,8,9]. In middle-aged and older adults a reduced ABI is associated with increased mortality and increased risk of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease [1,10]. Studies correlating ABI, PAOD and coronary risk factors in patients undergoing coronary angiography, were, however, little explored in recent medical literature. The objectives of this study are to assess the prevalence of PAD in patients undergoing coronary angiography; in addition to analyzing the relationship between ABI and coronary artery disease, and its correlation with cardiovascular risk factors. METHOD Population After being informed about the research, agreed to participate and signed a free and informed consent, participated initially in this study 130 patients undergoing coronary angiography in coronary care unit of Hospital Santa Lucinda - Annex 3 to the Hospital Complex of Sorocaba, during the from June 2005 to May 2006. There were 17 patients who, however, were excluded from the initial sample, as they had an ITB value superior to 1.3; leaving, thus, effectively 113 patients included in the study sample and on the statistical analysis of the results. The age of participants ranged from 35 to 82 years, with a mean of 65.91 ± 13.44 years. As to gender, 53.10% (60) were male and 46.90% (53) female. Method The design is an observational and cross-sectional study - type survey. Before the cineangiocoronariographic study, a Doppler ultrasound (Vascular Doppler; DV610; MEDMEGA, Brazil) apparatus was used to measure ITB, and cardiovascular risk factors were investigated, based on a specifically elaborated script, including age (in years), sex, smoking, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, and obesity. After the coronary angiography, patients were divided initially into two groups - patients without coronary artery disease and patients with coronary artery disease. Subsequently, the patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of coronary disease: Group 1 - absence of coronary lesions; Group 2 - mild to moderate obstructive disease (when the stenosis was less than 70% in at least one major coronary artery _ right or left coronary artery and its branches, anterior descending artery and circumflex artery); and Group 3 - severe obstructive disease (when the injury took 70% or more of the arterial diameter, to say the least, one of the main coronary arteries: right or left coronary artery and its branches, anterior descending artery and circumflex artery). Patients whose coronary angiography results showed parietal irregularities or diffuse calcifications atheromatosis, at least one of the aforementioned coronary arteries were included in group 2. In addition, ABI values above 1.3 represented the only exclusion criterion of patients in this study, as they are associated with diffuse disease of the vessels with calcification of the middle layer and vascular wall rigidity, which makes the arteries non- compressible during inflation of the cuff. [3] This phenomenon, which occurs more frequently in high cardiovascular risk groups, such as diabetics, the elderly and patients with chronic kidney failure, affects the value and clinical significance of the ABI [3]. Patients, therefore, who had ABI > 1.3 were excluded from this study. This research was approved by the Teaching and Research Site Commission. Cardiovascular risk factors. Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as weight (kg)/ height (m) 2. Obesity is defined by the BMI when it's above 30 kg /m2. Smoking was determined, according to the classification of patients in smokers at the time of the interview (at least 10 cigarettes/day) and non-smokers (including ex-smokers for at least two years ago, and non smokers). The alcohol consumption was defined as alcoholics at the time of the interview (regardless of the amount consumed) and non-alcoholic (including former consumers for at least a year without drinking). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg, or current use of antihypertensive medications for blood pressure control. Diabetes mellitus was considered present when there was a previous diagnosis of diabetes or when the patient reported taking insulin or hypoglycemic agents, or when the fasting plasma glucose was equal to or greater than 126 mg/dL in the absence of prior diagnosis. It was not included as variables of the study, total cholesterol and fractions and triglycerides, the difficulty in obtaining the laboratory dosages. ABI The ABI is a simple, cost-effective and non-invasive for early detection of PAOD which complements the assessment of cardiovascular risk. This examination has been recommended in clinical practice, in order to measure the patency of the arterial circulation of the lower limbs. The researchers of this study were specifically trained to perform the ABI measurement under standard conditions. The measurements were performed after the patient rest 5 minutes in the supine position. Systolic blood pressures were measured in the following order: the right brachial artery; posterior tibial artery and right dorsalis pedis; posterior tibial artery and left dorsalis pedis; and the left brachial artery. The ABI was calculated as the ratio between the highest of the two systolic (posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis) below the ankle with the greatest pressure of the brachial portion. The pressures of both legs were measured and the ABI was calculated for each leg. In the case of absence of the ABI in one leg (amputation) or brachial systolic pressure in one arm, the value of the contralateral limbs were used. Likewise, in the absence of the blood pressure value in one of the legs (tibial and dorsalis pedis), the value of the other leg was used for the calculation of ABI. PAD was defined as ABI < 0.90. The lowest ABI between the two legs was used as a reference for data analysis. Patients, therefore, were divided into two groups according to the ABI: ABI > 0.90 and ABI < 0.90. Statistical analysis was used SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), in its version 13.0, to obtain the results. Parametric variables were presented as means ± standard deviation. Analyzing the sample divided into two groups, the absence and presence of coronary lesions, the Mann-Whitney test was applied. Comparing the patients, who were divided into three groups according to the degree of coronary involvement, first we used the Kruskal-Wallis test and then the variables that showed statistical significance were analyzed on a par with the Mann-Whitney test. The Spearman correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between cardiovascular risk factors and the value of the ABI, for the presence of coronary artery lesions. The logistic regression analysis, that included statistically significant variables in Spearman correlation analysis, was performed to evaluate the probability of coronary lesions, based on the ABI and cardiovascular risk factors, included in the study. Analyzing the group with ABI > 0.90 and the group with ABI < 0.90, Mann-Whitney test was applied. For non-parametric variables were calculated the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI), both in relation to PAOD and in relation to coronary artery disease. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of patients with and without coronary artery disease. Of the 113 patients included in the statistical analysis, 53.10% were male and 46.90% female. The mean age and the mean BMI was 65.91 ± 13.44 years old and 30.09 ± 4.39 kg / m2, respectively. In addition, 47.79% are smokers, 61.95% are diabetic, 66.37% are hypertensive and 15.04% are alcoholics. The average of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were, respectively, 149.09 ± 22.44 mmHg, 92.84 ± 11.84 mmHg and 56.16 ± 14.57 mmHg. There was a significant difference in age (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), BMI (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) and pulse pressure (p < 0.001) among those who had and those who did not have coronary artery lesions. There was no significant difference in gender (p = 0.186) and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.145). The mean value of ABI was 0.83 ± 0.18 in the total sample, 0.98 ± 0.08 in patients without coronary disease and 0.71 ± 0.14 in patients with coronary artery disease. There was a significant difference between the latter two groups (p < 0.001). Patients with coronary artery disease were older than those without it(73.08 ± 10.15 vs. 56.21 ± 11.09 years); plus a predominance of males (58.46% vs. 45.83%); a bigger proportion of smokers (69.23% vs. 18.75%), hypertension (84.62% vs. 41.67%) and diabetes (67.69% vs. 54.17%); highest average BMI (32.35 ± 2.67 vs. 27.02 ± 4.42), systolic blood pressure (160.34 ± 21.11 vs. 133.85 ± 13.45), diastolic blood pressure (98, 34 ± 11.12 vs. 85.40 ± 8.21) and pulse pressure (62.00 ± 15.78 vs. 48.25 ± 7.48); and lower average value of ABI (0.71 ± 0.14 vs. 0.98 ± 0:08). Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of patients divided into three groups according to the severity of the coronary artery disease. As to age range, the mean age of group 1 was 56.21 ± 11.09 years; in the case of group 2 it was 66.67 ± 7.00 years; and for group 3 it was 77.63 ± 9.61 years.
 As to gender, group 1 consisted of 45.83% males and 54.17% females; group 2 of 48.15% males and 51.85% females; and group 3 of 65.79% males and 34.21% females. Age range (p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.030), systemic arterial hypertension (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), BMI (p < 0.001), systolic pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic pressure (p < 0.001) and pulse pressure (p < 0.001) presented statistically significant differences when the three groups were analyzed concomitantly.
 Moreover, the mean ABI value was 0.98 ± 0.08 in group 1; 0.80 ± 0.12 in group 2; and 0.65 ± 0.11 in group 3.
 There was a significant difference between the three groups in respect to ABI (p < 0.001). Analyzing the three groups when combined pairwise (Group 1 vs. Group 2, Group 1 vs. Group 3, and Group 2 vs. Group 3), we observed that the patients in the three groups differed significantly as to age range, BMI, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure, and ABI.
 There was no significant difference between groups 2 and 3 with regard to smoking and systemic arterial hypertension, and there was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 as to diabetes mellitus.
 Table 3 shows the risk and comorbidity factors associated with coronary artery disease, based on the odds ratio.
 We observed in this analysis that age range (OR: 3.750; CI: 1.377-10.209, p = 0.010); systemic arterial hypertension (OR: 4.900; CI: 1.675-14.336, p = 0.004), smoking (OR: 6.303; CI: 2.193-18.116, p = 0.001); and BMI (OR: 19.341; CI: 5.502-67.991; p < 0.001) were strongly associated with coronary lesions < 70%; whereas ABI > 0.90 (OR: 0.026; CI: 0.007-0.101; p < 0.001) was not associated with coronary lesions < 70% and is therefore a protective factor for this kind of lesion.
 Similarly, age range (OR: 25.500; CI: 7.492-86.790; p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR: 3.173; CI: 1.209- 8.326; p = 0.019), systemic arterial hypertension (OR: 11.900; CI: 3.641-38.895; p < 0.001), smoking (OR: 13.963; CI: 4.928-39.562; p < 0.001) and BMI (OR: 60.545; CI: 12.534-292.466; p < 0.001) were strongly associated with coronary lesions > 70 %; whereas BMI ³0,90 (OR: 0.003; CI: 0.000-0.028; p < 0.001) was not associated with coronary lesions > 70% and is also a protective factor for severe coronary artery disease.
 Spearman's Correlation Analysis shows that age range (p<0.001), systemic arterial hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<;0.001), BMI (p<0.001), systolic pressure (p<0.001), diastolic pressure (p<0.001), pulse pressure (p < 0.001) and ABI (p<0.001) were directly correlated with the presence of coronary lesions.
 There was no statistically significant correlation between gender (p= 0.187) or diabetes mellitus (p= 0.146) and coronary lesion. Logistic Regression Analysis shows that patients with ABI < 0.90, BMI > 30 kg/m2 and age > 60 were the most likely to have coronary lesions (98.93%), whereas patients with ABI > 0.90, BMI < 30 kg/m2 and age < 60 were the most likely to have coronary lesions (1.33%).
 On the other hand, patients with ABI > 0.90, BMI > 30 kg/m2 and age > 60 had a likelihood of coronary lesions of 53.71%; whereas patients with ABI < 0.90, BMI < 30 kg/m2 and age < 60 had a likelihood of coronary lesions of 51.86%. Table 4 shows the clinical characteristics of patients with and without PAOD, ordered according to the ABI value. Of the 113 patients included in the study, 56.60% (64) were shown to have PAOD (ABI < 0.90), whereas 90.76% (59) of CAD patients showed concomitant PAOD.
 PAOD prevalence was higher in males (57.80%) than in females (42.20%). PAOD patients showed a more advanced age range than those without PAOD (72.34 ± 11.40 vs. 57.51 ± 11.11 years); in addition to a predominance of male individuals (57.80% vs. 46.90%); a greater proportion of smokers (68.75% vs. 20.41%), hypertensive individuals (85.94% vs. 40.82%) and diabetics (68.75% vs. 53.06%); higher mean BMI (32.13 ± 2.99 vs. 27.42 ± 4.53), systolic pressure (161.33 ± 20.42 vs. 133.10 ± 12.93), diastolic pressure (98, 73 ± 10.97 vs. 85.14 ± 7.89) and pulse pressure (62.59 ± 15.32 vs. 47.76 ± 7.74); and lower mean ABI (0.70 ± 0.11 vs. 0.98 ± 0.01).
 There was a significant difference between individuals with and without PAOD in respect to age range (p < 0.001), systemic arterial hypertension (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), BMI (p < 0.001), systolic pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic pressure (p < 0.001) and pulse pressure (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in respect gender (p = 0.253) and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.090). Table 5 shows the risk factors and comorbidities associated with PAOD, based on the odds ratio (OR). We observed in this analysis that diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.76, CI: 1.53-2.02; p < 0.001), hypertension (OR: 1.06, CI: 1.05-1.07; p < 0.001) and smoking (OR: 1.17, CI: 1.04-1.19; p < 0.001) were strongly associated with PAOD, whereas BMI < 30 kg/m2 (OR: 0.08, CI: 0.03 -0.20; p < 0.001) was not associated with PAOD, and is therefore a protective factor for PAOD. DISCUSSION Patients who have undergone coronary cineangiography present increased cardiovascular risk per se, since they display significant percentages of risk factors for atherosclerotic phenomena in coronary arterial beds and subsequent acute myocardial infarction, such as old age, male gender, smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension and obesity [11].
 Among the 65 coronary patients included in this study we found a more advanced age range; a greater proportion of smokers, hypertensive patients and diabetics; and higher mean values of systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure, when compared to patients without coronary artery disease.
 Moreover, Spearman's Correlation Analysis showed that age range, systemic arterial hypertension, smoking, BMI, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure were strongly associated with the presence of coronary lesions.
 Our results agree with the data reported by Iglézias et al.  [11] and Brevetti et al. [12], showing the strong influence of cardiovascular risk factors on the development of atherosclerotic and atherothrombotic coronary phenomena.
 Furthermore, Sesso et al. [13] pointed out that in patients under 60 years of age, systolic and diastolic pressures are significant cardiovascular risk predictors, whereas in patients over 60 only systolic and pulse pressures were associated with cardiovascular risks.
 In this study we have also analyzed the relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and the severity of coronary artery impairment. Our results showed a significant difference for age range, smoking, diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension and BMI, in respect to the severity of coronary artery disease.
 Furthermore, we found that coronariopathy severity is directly associated with an older age range and higher mean values of BMI, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure.
 The odds ratio calculation showed that age range, systemic arterial hypertension, smoking and BMI were strongly associated with the presence of both mild to moderate coronary lesion (lesion < 70%) and severe coronary lesion (> 70%), thereby showing, once again, the impact of cardiovascular risk factors on the development of atherosclerotic processes in coronary arterial beds.
 As to the ABI, our research found that patients with coronary artery disease had a significantly lower mean ABI value than individuals without coronariopathy (p < 0.001).
 Moreover, based on the calculation of the odds ratio, an ABI > 0.90 constitutes a protective factor both for mild to moderate coronary lesion (lesion < 70%) and severe coronary artery impairment (lesion > 70%).
 These results agree with the data reported by other researchers, suggesting a strong inverse relationship between ABI and coronariopathy [8,14-16]. Using Logistic Regression Analysis, our study also found that older obese patients with reduced ABI (< 0.90) had a likelihood of coronary lesions of 98.93%, whereas young nonobese patients with normal ABI values (> 0.90) had a likelihood of coronary lesions of 1.33%.
 In addition, young nonobese patients with reduced ABI (< 0.90) presented a coronary lesion risk of 51.86%. These results suggest that reduced ABI levels may be a marker and predictor of coronary atherosclerosis, either independently or combined with other cardiovascular risk factors, again suggesting a strong inverse relationship between ABI and the presence of coronary lesions.
 Our results highlight the importance of considering reduced ABI levels as a risk factor for patients whose symptomatology is consistent with coronary disease. Based on the direct relationship between the severity of coronary disease and reduced ABI levels, as shown by this study, cardiovascular surgeons must be aware of the importance of ABI measures for the clinical evaluation of patients with coronariopathy risks, as well as of their pivotal role in therapeutic decisions about the need for surgical myocardium revascularization in patients with severe coronary lesions.
 As a marker of asymptomatic PAOD, the ABI provides important information about subclinical atherosclerosis, and it is also an important predictor of cardiovascular events [17]. An ABI value < 0.90 presents 90% to 97% sensitivity and 98% to 100% specificity for the detection of arterial stenoses that affect 50% or more of the lumen in one or more large vessels of the lower limbs [3].
 In this study, 56.60% of the patients had PAOD, which was found to be more prevalent in males (57.80%) than in females (42.20%). Moreover, 90.76% of coronariopathy patients had concomitant PAOD, thus confirming the systemic nature of atherosclerosis phenomena.
 As to the prevalence of PAOD, our results exceed the 25.4% value found by Hasimu et al.  [18]; whereas our figures on the prevalence of PAOD in coronariopathy patients are lower than the 98% reported by Sukhija et al.
 [19].
 In a study on smoking and peripheral arterial disease, Lu et al. [20] identified smoking as a major risk factor not only for coronary artery disease, but for PAOD as well.
 The results obtained by this study agree with the data reported in the literature, since the prevalence of smoking was higher both in coronariopathy and PAOD patients
(69.23% and 68.75%, respectively). 
 Smoking also showed a direct association with the severity of coronary artery disease, and it seems to increase the risk of PAOD by 1.17.
 The aforementioned results prove the influence of this risk factor on the development of generalized atherosclerotic and atherothrombotic phenomena, both in coronary and peripheral arterial beds [18,21]. In their assessment of the beneficial cardiovascular properties of wine,  Cordova et al. [22] argue that moderate alcohol consumption (20 to 30g/day) is a protective factor for coronary artery disease, reducing the risk of coronariopathy by 40%. In this study, the prevalence of alcoholism was higher both in patients without coronary impairment (16.67%) and individuals without PAOD (20.41%), proving to be a possible, albeit not significant, independent protective factor for PAOD and coronary disease, as previously reported by Meijer et al. 
 [23]. According to Framingham's study [24], systemic hypertension increases the risk of PAOD by 2.5% in males and 3.9% in females, with pulse pressure being a more powerful cardiovascular event predictor than systolic or diastolic pressure alone.
 In our study, the impact of systemic arterial hypertension on the development of atherothrombotic phenomena was observed both in coronary arteries and peripheral arterial beds, since a high percentage of hypertensive patients had coronary artery disease (84.62%) and PAOD (85, 94%).
 Hypertension also demonstrated a direct association with the severity of the coronary artery disease, as well as apparently increasing the risk of developing PAOD by 1.06. A significant difference with respect to the systolic, diastolic and pulse, not only among patients with coronary artery disease, but also among individuals with PAOD was also oberved in this study. Regarding systolic blood pressure and pulse, our results are in concordance with those observed by Hasimu et al. [18], strengthening the role of these risk factors in the development of atherosclerosis processes in different vascular territories, as well as confirming the concurrence between the risk factors for coronary artery disease and PAOD. Murabito et al.  [25], on evaluating the prevalence and clinical correlations of peripheral arterial disease, identified diabetes mellitus as an important risk factor not only for coronary artery disease but also for asymptomatic and symptomatic PAOD. Additionally, besides stating that the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases in patients with reduced ABIs. 
 The results of this study are in concordance with the literature, since the prevalence of diabetes was higher in individuals with coronary artery disease (67.69%), and in patients with PAOD (68.65%). Diabetes mellitus also showed a direct association with the severity of the coronary artery disease, and it seems to increase by 1.76 the risk of developing DAOP. Our results demonstrate the influence of diabetes mellitus on the development of atherosclerotic phenomena, both in coronary and peripheral arterial beds [18,21,23]. From the previous data, it is important to appreciate a reduction in the independent ABI of the extent, as an important risk factor in individuals with compatible symptoms with coronary artery disease, and it also provides an important indication of the level of coronary artery occlusion.

 The presence of two comorbidities is notable, PAOD and coronary artery disease, that influence negatively and expressively by their interrelationships, contributing dramatically to the development of ischemic heart disease and the need for surgical treatment with revascularization myocardium. CONCLUSION The study suggests that a reduced ITB (<0.90) is a possible marker of the coronary artery disease in patients at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Due to the high concordance between PAD and the coronary artery disease in this study (90.76%), the importance of determining the ABI as an indispensable tool in clinical assessment protocol for patients at risk for coronary disease is stressed. In addition, an ABI > 0.90 constituted a protective factor for both moderate and severe coronary artery injury. It is suggested also that risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, are adequately treated and that obesity and smoking are strongly discouraged.
