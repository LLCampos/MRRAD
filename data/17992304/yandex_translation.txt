 ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: to Evaluate the prevalence of arterial disease obstructive peripheral (DAOP) in coronary artery disease. Evaluate the relationship between Ankle-brachial Index (ABI) and coronary heart disease, and its correlation with cardiovascular risk factors. METHOD: ABI investigated with ultrasound Doppler. Clinical characteristics researched: age, sex, diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, alcohol consumption, smoking and obesity. Population: 113 patients submitted to coronary angiography. First analysis: 2 groups - absence and presence of coronary artery disease. Second analysis: 3 groups - Group 1 - absence of injury coronary artery; Group 2 - stenosis < 70%; and Group 3 - stenosis > 70%. Third analysis: 2 groups - absence and presence of DAOP. RESULTS: 90,76% of coronary artery disease presented with DAOP. There was no significant difference regarding the age (p<0.001), hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), systolic pressure (p<0.001), diastolic (p<0.001) and wrist (p<0.001) and AAI (p<0.001) between individuals with and without lesion coronary. There was no significant difference regarding the age (p<0.001), diabetes (p=0.030), hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), systolic pressure (p<0.001), diastolic (p<0.001) and wrist (p<0.001) and AAI (p<0.001) between the patients divided as to the degree of coronary artery disease. There was no significant difference regarding the age (p<0.001), hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), systolic pressure (p<0.001), diastolic (p<0.001) and wrist (p<0.001) between patients with and without DAOP. By Logistic Regression Analysis, older patients, obese, and with ABI < 0,90 present likelihood of injury to the coronary of 98,93%. CONCLUSION: ABI < 0,90 is a possible marker of coronary artery disease in patients with risk of cardiovascular disease. Keywords: Ankle, blood irrigation. The brachial artery. Atherosclerosis. Peripheral vascular disease. Risk factors. INTRODUCTION peripheral arterial occlusive disease (DAOP), whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, characterized by a gradual reduction of blood flow, due to a process obstructive in beds arterial of the lower limbs [1-4]. In the vast majority of the time, its cause comes from the phenomena of the atherosclerotic and atherothrombotic, but it may also reflect the influence of other diseases, such as arteritis, aneurysm, and embolism [1-4]. Intermittent claudication, ie, a burning pain or cramp in the calf or buttocks after physical activity, is the clinical manifestation most common of DAOP [1,3,4]. Your diagnostic approach, however, should also include careful physical examination, with investigation of clinical signs suggestive, such as, the absence of pulses the peripheral, frêmitos arterial and changes of the skin in the affected limb, as well as the confirmation of the severity of vascular obstruction, as determined by measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) - which expresses the relationship between the systolic blood pressure in the artery tibial or later pediosa compared to the systolic pressure in the brachial artery [3]. The risk factors for DAOP are similar to those associated with coronary artery disease and include advanced age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity and systemic arterial hypertension [1,5]. The prevalence of DAOP in the general population, in individuals above 55 years old is 19.1% [6]; whereas in patients above 65 years is 19.8% and 16,8%, respectively, in men and women [7]. Given the coexistence of frequent atherosclerotic processes in different territories vascular diseases, previous studies have shown that the ITB has a strong correlation with the presence and severity of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries, coronary disease [1,8,9]. In middle-aged adults and the elderly, a ITB decreased is associated with the increased mortality and high risk of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease [1,10]. Research correlating to the ITB, DAOP and coronary risk factors in patients submitted to coronary angiography, were, however, sparsely explored in the medical literature current. The objectives of this study consist in assessing the prevalence of DAOP in patients submitted to coronary angiography; in addition to analyze the relationship between the ITB and coronary artery disease, and its correlation with cardiovascular risk factors. METHOD the Population After they have been informed about the research, agreed to participate and signed a term of free and clarified consent, took part initially in this study 130 patients submitted to coronary angiography in the coronary care unit of the Hospital Santa Lucinda - annex 3 to the Set Hospital of Sorocaba, during the period from June 2005 to may 2006. They were, however, excluded from the initial sample, 17 patients who presented with value of ITB exceeding 1,3; leaving, in this way, 113 patients effectively included in the series of the study and in the statistical analysis of the results. The age of the participants ranged from 35 to 82 years, with an average 65,91 ± 13,44 years. As to sex, 53,10% (60) were male and 46,90% (53) of the female sex. The methods Outlined is an observational study and cross - type survey. Prior to the study cineangiocoronariográfico has the measure of the ITB, with the use of a device of ultrasound Doppler (Doppler Vascular; DV610; MEDMEGA, Brazil), and have been investigated cardiovascular risk factors, from the script that is specifically designed, which included age (years), sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, and obesity. After completion of coronary angiography, the patients were divided, first, into two groups - patients free of coronary artery disease and patients with coronary artery disease. Subsequently, the patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of coronary heart disease: Group 1 - absence of injury coronary artery; Group 2 - disease obstructive mild to moderate (when the stenosis was less than 70% in at least one coronary artery main _ right coronary artery or the left and its branches, artery descending anterior and artery circunflexa); and Group 3 - disease obstructive (severe when the lesion occupied 70% or more of the diameter of blood of, at minimum, one of the coronary arteries: right coronary artery or the left and its branches, artery descending anterior and artery circunflexa). Patients whose results of coronary angiography showed irregularities in the parietal bones, calcifications, or ateromatose diffuse, in at least one of the coronary arteries already mentioned, were included in group 2. In addition, the values of ITB higher than 1.3 represented the single exclusion criterion of patients for this research, since they are associated with atherosclerotic disease diffuse vessels with calcification of the middle layer and stiffness of the vascular wall, which makes their arteries non-compressible during inflation of the cuff [3]. This phenomenon, which occurs with greater frequency in groups at high cardiovascular risk, such as diabetics, the elderly and patients with chronic renal failure, compromises the value and the clinical significance of ITB [3]. Patients, therefore, presented ITB > to 1.3 were excluded from this study. This research was authorized by the Commission of Education, and Local Search. Cardiovascular risk factors The Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Obesity was considered as BMI above 30 kg/m2. The tobacco was determined according to the classification of patients in smokers at the time of the interview (at least 10 cigarettes/day) and non-smokers (including ex-smokers for at least two years ago, and never smokers). The consumption of alcoholic beverages has been set in consumed alcohol at the time of the interview (regardless of the amount consumed and not consumed alcohol (comprising ex-consumers for at least a year ago, or never consumers). Systemic arterial hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg, or current use of antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure. Diabetes mellitus was considered present when there was a previous diagnosis of diabetes or when the patient reported use of insulin or agents hypoglycaemic, or when the fasting plasma glucose was equal to or greater than 126 mg/dL, in the absence of prior diagnosis. Were not included, as the study's variables, the values of total cholesterol and fractions and triglycerides, by the difficulty of obtaining measurements in the laboratory. Ankle-brachial index THE ABI is a simple, cost-effective and non-invasive way for early detection of DAOP and completion of cardiovascular risk assessment. This examination has been recommended in daily clinical practice, with the objective of measuring the perviedade of the arterial circulation of the lower limbs. The researchers in this study have been specifically trained to carry out the measurement of the ITB in standardized conditions. The measurements were performed after the patient rest 5 minutes in supine. The pressures arterial systolic were measured in the following order: the brachial artery right artery tibial posterior and pediosa right; artery tibial posterior and pediosa left; and left brachial artery. The ITB was calculated as the ratio between the higher of the two pressures systolic (artery tibial posterior and pediosa) below the ankle with the increased pressure of the portion of the brachial. The pressures of both legs were measured and the ABI was calculated separately for each leg. In the case of the absence of the value of the ITB in one of the legs (amputation), or of the systolic pressure, the brachial in one of the arms, the value of the members contralateral were used. In the same way, in the absence of the blood pressure value in one of the legs (tibial or later pediosa), the value of the other leg was used for the calculation of the ITB. DAOP was defined as an ABI < 0,90. The lower value of the ITB between the two legs was used as the reference for the analysis of the data. Patients, thus, were divided into two groups according to the value of ITB: ITB > 0,90 and ABI < 0,90. Statistical analysis we Used the program SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 13.0, to obtain the results. The variables parametric were provided as the mean ± standard deviation. Analyzing the sample divided into two groups, in the absence and presence of injury to the coronary, was applied the Mann-Whitney Test. By comparing the patients, divided in three groups according to the degree of impairment, coronary artery, was first used the Kruskal-Wallis Test and, subsequently, the variables that presented statistical significance were analyzed on a par with the Mann-Whitney Test. The Correlation Analysis of Spearman was performed to evaluate the correlation between cardiovascular risk factors and the value of ITB, with respect to the presence of injury to the coronary. The Logistic Regression Analysis, which included variables statistically significant in the Correlation Analysis of Spearman was performed to assess the probability of injury to the coronary, based on the value of the ITB and in the cardiovascular risk factors included in the study. Analyzing the group with ABI > 0,90 and the group with ABI < 0,90, was applied the Mann-Whitney Test. For the variables non-parametric, were calculated the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI), both in relation to the DAOP and in relation to coronary artery disease. P values<0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS Table 1 displays the clinical characteristics of patients with and without coronary artery disease. Of the 113 patients included in the statistical analysis, 53,10% belonged to male sex and 46,90%, to the feminine sex. The mean age and mean BMI were 65,91±13,44 years and czk 30.09±arachidic 4.39 kg/m2, respectively. In addition, 47,79% are smokers, 61,95% are diabetics, 66,37% are hypertensive and 15,04% consumed alcohol. The average value of systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure were, respectively, 149,09±22,44 mmHg, 92,84±11,84 mmHg and 56,16±14,57 mmHg. There was no significant difference regarding the age (p<0.001), systemic arterial hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), systolic pressure (p<0.001), diastolic pressure (p<0.001) and pulse pressure (p<0.001) between individuals who had and those who did not show commitment to the coronary artery. There was no significant difference regarding sex (p=0,186) and diabetes mellitus (p=0,145). The average value of ABI was 0.83±0,18 in the total sample is 0.98±0,08 in patients without coronary artery disease and 0,71±0,14 in patients with coronary heart disease. There was no significant difference between the latter two groups (p<0.001). Patients with coronary artery disease presented more advanced age groups than those without coronary artery disease (73,08±10,15 vs 56,21±11,09 years); in addition to the predominance of male individuals (58,46% vs. 45,83%); higher proportion of smokers (69,23% vs. 18,75%), hypertensive (84,62% vs. 41,67%) and diabetic (67,69% vs. 54,17%); higher mean value of BMI (32,35±2,67 vs. 27,02±4,42), systolic pressure (160,34±21,11 vs. 133,85±13,45), diastolic pressure (98,34±11,12 vs. 85,40±8,21) and pulse pressure (62,00±15,78 vs. 48,25±7,48); and lower average value of the ITB (0,71±0,14 vs. to 0.98±0.08). Table 2 displays the clinical characteristics of the patients divided into three groups according to the severity of coronary artery disease. As regards age group, the mean age of group 1 was 56,21±11,09 years; group 2 was 66.67±7,00 years; and group 3 was 77,63±9,61 years. Regarding gender, the group 1 was formed by 45,83% of men and 54,17% women; group 2, by 48,15% men and 51,85% for females; and group 3, by 65,79% men and 34,21% women. The age group (p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.030), the systemic arterial hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), systolic pressure (p<0.001), diastolic pressure (p<0.001) and pulse pressure (p<0.001) showed significant difference statistically, when the three groups were analyzed simultaneously. In addition, the mean value of ABI was 0.98±0,08, in the patients of group 1, 0,80±0,12 in group 2, and 0.65±0,11 in group 3. There was a significant difference between the three groups, as to the value of ITB (p<0.001). By analyzing the three groups of patients, when combined one pair at a time (Group 1 x Group 2, Group 1 x Group 3 and Group 2 x Group 3), we observed that the patients of the three groups differed significantly from each other with regard to age, BMI, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure, and ITB. There was no significant difference between groups 2 and 3 for smoking and hypertension; while there was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 for diabetes mellitus. Table 3 displays the risk factors and comorbidity associated to coronary artery disease, based on the calculation of the odds-ratio. We observe, after this analysis, which age group (OR: 3,750; IC: 1,377-10,209; p=0.010), systemic arterial hypertension (OR: 4,900; CI: 1,675-14,336; p=0.004), smoking (OR: 6,303; CI: 2,193-18,116; p=0.001) and BMI (OR: 19,341; IC: 5,502-67,991; p<0.001) were strongly associated with the injury, coronary < 70%; ABI > 0,90 (OR: 0,026; IC: 0,007-0,101; p<0.001) was not associated to injury, coronary < 70%, constituting, therefore, a protection factor for this type of injury. In a similar manner, age range (OR: 25.500; IC: 7,492-86,790; p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR: 3,173; IC: 1,209-8,326; p=0.019), systemic arterial hypertension (OR: 11,900; IC: 3,641-38,895; p<0.001), smoking (OR: 13,963; IC: 4,928-39,562; p<0.001) and BMI (OR: 60,545; IC: 12,534-292,466; p<0.001) were strongly associated with injury coronary > 70%; while the ITB 30,90 (OR: 0,003; IC: 0,000-0,028; p<0.001) was not associated to injury, coronary > 70%, and it constitutes also a protective factor for coronary artery disease serious. By the Analysis of Spearman rank Correlation, age (p<0.001), systemic arterial hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), systolic pressure (p<0.001), diastolic pressure (p<0.001), pulse pressure (p<0.001) and AAI (p<0.001) were directly correlated to the presence of injury to the coronary. There was no correlation statistically significant between sex (p=0.187) and diabetes mellitus (p=0,146) and injury to the coronary. By Logistic Regression Analysis, we found that patients with ABI < 0,90, BMI > 30 kg/m2 and age > 60 years had the highest probability of injury to the coronary (98,93%); while patients with ABI > 0,90, BMI < 30 kg/m2 and age < 60 years had the lowest likelihood of injury to the coronary (1,33%). Already patients with ABI > 0,90, BMI > 30 kg/m2 and age > 60 years showed a likelihood of injury to the coronary of 53,71%; while patients with ABI < 0,90, BMI < 30 kg/m2 and age < 60 years had a likelihood of injury to the coronary of 51,86%. Table 4 displays the clinical characteristics of patients with and without DAOP, divided according to the value of the ITB. Of the 113 patients included in the study, 56,60% (64) presented DAOP (ABI<0,90), being that 90,76% (59) of the patients with coronary artery disease presented concurrently DAOP. The prevalence of DAOP was greater in males (57,80%) than in females (42,20%). Patients with DAOP showed more advanced age groups than those without DAOP (72,34±11,40 vs. 57,51±com 11.11 years); in addition to the predominance of male individuals (57,80% vs. 46,90%); higher proportion of smokers (68,75% vs. 20,41%), hypertensive (85,94% vs. 40,82%) and diabetic patients (68,75% vs. 53,06%); higher mean value of BMI (32,13±2,99 vs. 27,42±4,53), systolic pressure (161,33±20,42 vs. 133,10±12,93), diastolic pressure (98,73±10,97 vs. 85,14±7,89) and pulse pressure (62,59±15,32 vs. 47,76±of 7.74); and lower average value of the ITB (0,70±0,11 vs 0,98±0,01). There was no significant difference regarding the age (p<0.001), systemic arterial hypertension (p<0.001), smoking (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), systolic pressure (p<0.001), diastolic pressure (p<0.001) and pulse pressure (p<0.001) among the individuals who presented and not presented DAOP. There was no significant difference regarding sex (p=0,253) and diabetes mellitus (p=0,090). Table 5 displays the risk factors and comorbidities associated with the DAOP, based on the calculation of the odds-ratio (OR). We observe, after this analysis, diabetes mellitus (OR: 1,76; CI: 1,53-2,02; p<0.001), systemic arterial hypertension (OR: 1,06; IC: 1,05-1,07; p<0.001) and smoking (OR: 1,17; CI: 1,04-1,19; p<0.001) were strongly associated with the DAOP; while BMI < 30 kg/m2 (OR: 0,08; CI: 0,03-0,20; p<0.001) was not associated to DAOP, it constitutes a protection factor for DAOP. DISCUSSION patients who undergo coronary angiography have per se an increased cardiovascular risk, a time that display percentages of significant risk factors for phenomena atherosclerotic in beds arterial coronary and later acute myocardial infarction, such as, advanced age, male sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, and obesity [11]. Among the 65 patients coronary artery disease in this study, we found individuals with age range more elevated; higher proportion of smokers, hypertensive and diabetics; largest average value of systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure, when compared with the patients who did not have coronary artery disease. In addition, by Analysis of Spearman rank Correlation, age, systemic arterial hypertension, smoking, BMI, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure were strongly associated with the presence of injury to the coronary. Our results agree with the data observed by Iglézias et al. [11] and Brevetti et al. [12], demonstrating the strong influence of cardiovascular risk factors in the development of the phenomena in atherosclerotic and atherothrombotic coronary. In addition, Sesso et al. [13] emphasized that, in patients below the age of 60, the systolic and diastolic pressures are important predictors of cardiovascular risk, whereas in individuals above 60 years of age, only the pressures on the systolic and pulse were associated with this risk . We also, in this study, an analysis of the relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and the severity of impairment blood the coronary artery. Our results exhibited a significant difference for age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension and BMI, with the degree of coronary artery disease. In addition, we find that the severity of coronary artery disease is directly associated with the age range of the high and higher mean values of BMI, pressures systolic, diastolic and pulse. Based on the calculation of the odds-ratio, age, systemic arterial hypertension, smoking and BMI were strongly associated with the presence of both injury coronary mild-to-moderate injury (< 70%) and injury to the coronary severe injury (> 70%), highlighting, once more, the impact of cardiovascular risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic processes in beds arterial coronary. As for the ITB, we find in this research an average value of the ITB significantly lower in patients with coronary artery disease in relation to individuals free of coronary artery disease (p<0.001). In addition, based on the calculation of the odds-ratio, an ABI > 0,90 constitutes a protection factor for both injury coronary mild-to-moderate injury (< 70%) and for commitment to blood coronary severe injury (> 70%). These results agree with the observed by other researchers, suggesting a strong inverse relationship between ABI and coronary artery disease [8,14-16]. We also found, in this study, from the Logistic Regression Analysis, older patients, obese, and with the ITB decreased (<0,90), showed a likelihood of injury to the coronary of 98,93%; while that young patients, non-obese and with ITB normal (>0,90) presented a likelihood of injury to the coronary 1.33%. In addition, young patients, non-obese, but with the ITB decreased (<0,90) presented a risk of injury to the coronary of 51,86%. These results point to an ITB decreased as a possible marker and predictor of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, independently or associated with other cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting again a strong inverse relationship between the ITB and the presence of injury to the coronary. According to our results, it is evident the importance of considering a ITB decreased, as a risk factor for patients with symptoms compatible with coronary heart disease. Based on the direct relationship between the severity of coronary artery disease and the reduction of the value of ITB as demonstrated in this study, the surgeons cardiovascular should be aware of the importance of the extent of the AAI in the clinical evaluation of patients at risk for coronary artery disease, in addition to its participation as an instrument essential to the therapeutic decision as to the need for eventual surgical procedure of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with lesions coronary serious. The ITB, as a marker of DAOP asymptomatic, it provides important information about atherosclerosis subclinical, in addition to being an important predictor of cardiovascular events [17]. A value of ABI < 0,90 sensitivity of 90% to 97% and specificity of 98% to 100% for detection of stenosis arterial that compromise 50% or more of light of one or more vessels of larger caliber of the lower limbs [3]. In this research, 56,60% of the patients presented with DAOP, being this prevalence higher in males (57,80%) than in females (42,20%). In addition, 90,76% of the coronary artery disease patients presented concomitantly DAOP, confirming the character of the systemic phenomena of the atherosclerotic. As to the prevalence of DAOP, our results outperform the 25,4% found by Hasimu et al. [18]; while in regard to the presence of DAOP in individuals with coronary artery disease, our data are lower than the 98% observed by Sukhija et al. [19]. Lu et al. [20], in a study on smoking and peripheral arterial disease, point out the tobacco smoking as an important risk factor not only for coronary artery disease, as well as for DAOP. The results found in this study agree with the literature, since the prevalence of smokers was higher both in subjects with coronary heart disease (69,23%), and in patients with DAOP (68,75%). Smoking also showed a direct association with the severity of coronary disease, in addition to seems to be increasing in 1,17 the risk of development of DAOP. By the results above, demonstrates the influence of this risk factor in the development of the phenomena in atherosclerotic and atherothrombotic widespread, both in beds arterial coronary how many in peripheral [18,21]. Cordova et al. [22]., evaluating the properties of cardiovascular beneficial wine, claim that the consumption amounts to moderate alcohol (20 to 30g/day) constitutes a protective factor for coronariopatias, reducing in 40% the risk for coronary artery disease. In this study, the prevalence of consumed alcohol was higher both in patients free from impairment, coronary artery (16,67%) as well as in individuals without DAOP (20,41%), proving to be a possible protective factor-independent, but not significant, for DAOP, and coronary heart disease, as observed previously by Meijer et al. [23]. According to the study of Framingham [24], the systemic blood pressure hypertension increases the risk of DAOP, 2.5% in men and 3.9% in women, being that pulse pressure is a predictor most powerful of cardiovascular events than systolic or diastolic alone. In our study, the impact of systemic arterial hypertension in the development of phenomena atherothrombotic has been observed in the coronary arteries as well as in the beds arterial peripheral, since a high percentage of the hypertensive patients presented coronary artery disease (84,62%), and DAOP (85,94%). The systemic arterial hypertension also exhibited a direct relationship with the severity of the affected coronary artery, in addition to seems to be increasing in 1.06 by the risk of development of DAOP. It was noted also, in this study, a significant difference in relation to the pressures of systolic, diastolic and pulse, not only among the patients with coronary artery disease, but also between individuals with DAOP. With regard to systolic blood pressure and pulse, our results agree with the observed by Hasimu et al. [18], reinforcing the role of these risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic processes in different territories vascular, in addition to ratifying the concurrence between the risk factors for both coronary artery disease and to DAOP. Murabito et al. [25], evaluating the prevalence and the correlations for the clinical peripheral arterial disease, also point out that the diabetes mellitus as an important risk factor not only for coronary artery disease, as well as for DAOP, asymptomatic and symptomatic, in addition to affirming that the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases in patients with ITB reduced. The results found in this study agree with the literature, since the prevalence of diabetes was higher both in subjects with coronary artery disease (67,69%), and in patients with DAOP (68,65%). Diabetes mellitus also showed a direct association with the severity of coronary disease, in addition to seems to be increasing in 1,76 the risk of development of DAOP. Our results demonstrate the influence of diabetes mellitus on the development of the phenomena in atherosclerotic, both in beds arterial coronary how many in peripheral [18,21,23]. By the data above, it is evident the need to value the ITB decreased, regardless of the degree of reduction of this index as an important risk factor in individuals with symptoms compatible with coronary heart disease, in addition to providing an important parameter of the severity of impairment, coronary artery. Notice the presence of two comorbidities, DAOP and coronary artery disease, that influence negatively in a significant manner by their inter-relationships, contributing in a way disastrous to the evolution of ischemic heart disease and for the need of surgical treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting. CONCLUSION THE study suggests that ITB decreased (<0,90) is a possible marker of coronary artery disease in patients with risk of cardiovascular diseases atherosclerotic. Due to the high concurrence between DAOP and coronary artery disease found in this study (90,76%), underlines the importance of the determination of the ITB as an essential tool in the protocol for the clinical evaluation of patients at risk for coronary heart disease. In addition, an ABI > 0,90 it was a protection factor for both injury coronary moderate as to injury to the coronary severe. It is suggested that risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension are adequately treated, and that obesity and smoking are strongly discouraged.
