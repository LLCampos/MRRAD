ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: A crucial aspect of inter vivos Liver transplantation is the risk posed to the donor due procedure be conducted in healthy person, with the possibility of high postoperative morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To correlate imaging findings of pre- and intra-operative of living liver donors adults. METHODS: Between 2003-2008 the charts of 66 donors were reviewed. There were 42 men (64%) and 24 women (36%) with a mean age of 30 years (± 8 years). Preoperative anatomy was analyzed by cholangiography by magnetic resonance imaging to study the bile ducts and computed tomography angiography for hepatic artery and portal vein. normality criteria were established according to previous studies of literature. RESULTS: Anatomical variations of the bile ducts were found in 59.1% of donors; hepatic artery in 31.8% and portal vein in 30.3% of cases preoperatively. Cholangiography magnetic resonance imaging showed concordant findings in 44 (66.6%) donors and discordant in 22 (33.3%). Regarding the hepatic artery in all donors the findings of imaging were consistent with the intraoperative. For CT portal vein consistent findings presented in 59 (89.4%) discordant donor and seven (10.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The anatomical variations of the bile ducts are frequent, with cholangiography by magnetic resonance imaging with moderate accuracy (70%) in the reproduction of surgical findings; CT reproduced the intraoperative findings of hepatic artery in 100% of donors, and reproduced the intraoperative findings in 89.4% of cases in the portal vein, with high accuracy (89%). Key words: Liver transplantation. Donors alive. Magnetic resonance imaging. X-ray tomography. Preoperative care INTRODUCTION In 1988, in Brazil, Ray et al.22 performed the first liver transplantation inter vivos, using the left hepatic lobe (segments II and III) of an adult donor transplanted into a pediatric recipient. In 1994, Yamoaka et al.28, with experience of more than 200 pediatric transplants performed, reported the first successful inter vivos transplantation among adults, taking advantage of the right hepatic lobe. A crucial issue to this form of liver transplantation lies in the risk posed to the donor by the application of the procedure to a healthy individual, capable of generating postoperative morbidity rate that can reach 21% and mortality 0.5% 17. One reason for these high rates of complications seem to be related to the large number of vascular anatomical variations and bilíferos ducts not recognized in the pre-operatório14. Anatomical variations of hepatic artery (HA) are commonly found in about 45% of cases of potential living donors fígado13,21,27. The identification of the arterial branch source that irrigates the IV segment is also very important, because its integrity is essential for the occurrence of regeneration of hepatic lobe esquerdo20. Changes in portal vein (PV) can be found in about 20% of the population and, although these do not constitute normally in contraindication to transplantation, they can, once recognized, making the longest surgical procedure requiring multiple anastomoses increasing risk tromboses10,15. This concern extends to, because only about 60% of donors have an anatomy of conventional bilíferos ducts, variations that provide great technical challenges for the realization of liver transplantation inter vivos or may represent contraindication to doação12,16,19. Thus it is required perfect preoperative knowledge of the anatomy of the portal triad donor elements to simplify the reconstruction procedure, both of vascular as biliary structures. It also reduces the rate at the same time recipients of postoperative morbidity that increases the quality of graft and safety and donor selection when several candidates are disponíveis4,24. For this, it has made use of computed tomography angiography (CTA) and cholangiography by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI cholangiocarcinoma), used as preoperative tests intended to analyze anatomical variations of the triad portal4,19,24 . The aim of this study was to correlate imaging findings preoperatively with those found in intraoperative of living liver donors adults.   METHODS We evaluated retrospectively in Hospital Charitable Portuguese São Paulo, the charts of 66 donors for liver transplantation inter vivos in the period between 2003 and 2008. Forty-two (64%) were male and 24 (36%) females, aged between 19 and 50 and an average of 30 years (± 8 years), body mass index (BMI) ranging from 19, 8 and 38.2 kg / m2 and average of 25.7 kg / m2 (± 3.9). The classification used for the description of the anatomical variations of bilíferos ducts was proposed by Couinaud9; for the HA, for Michels21 and VP by Akgul et al.2. Cholangiocarcinoma MRI imaging protocol was used MRI machines to 1.5T (GE ® Excite HD) and surface coils. 6 fasting was required to 8 h administered to patients and 20 mg of scopolamine butylbromide IV (Except in patients with allergy or glaucoma) minutes before positioning the device to reduce peristalsis artifacts. After localizing sequences were obtained series axial fast spin echo T2 with fat saturation with the following parameters: TE / TR 85 / 2000-2500 ms, FOV of 40 mm and 6 mm slice thickness with 2 mm interval. The colangiográficas series were obtained in volumetric sequences Fast Recovery Fast Spin Echo Coronal, trigadas with the patient's breathing with TE / TR 400 / 5000-12000 ms and FOV of 38 mm T2 sequences Single Shot Fast Spin Echo radial, centered on the common bile duct with TE / TR 400/2000 ms and FOV of 28 mm and sequence FIESTA® (Fast Imaging Employing Steady State Acquistion) coronal volume with TR / TE minimum, thickness of 3 to 3.6 mm and FOV of 38 mm. In some patients were still obtained Axial Gradient echo sequence T1 LAVA® (Liver aquisition with aceleration volume) by volume with TE / TR minimal thickness of 5 mm and FOV of 40 mm before and after gadolinium injection (0.2 ml / kg of patient weight). The examination time ranged from 20-30 minutes and the images were sent to dedicated workstations for manipulation. CT angiography were used multidetector devices with 16 and 64 channels (LighSpeed ​​- GE®, Aquilion 16 and 64 - and Toshiba® SOMATOM 128 - Siemens®) after intravenous injection 75-150mL of nonionic iodinated contrast through pump injection speeds of 3-5 ml / s, with 1-1.25 mm reconstructed 0.8-1 mm cuts. blood phases were acquired, and portal vein, the latter obtained only in patients with poor venous opacification. All series were sent for analysis on dedicated workstations. Statistical analysis To study the reproducibility between two qualitative variables, we used the Kappa coefficient, which ranges from zero to one. When was equal to one, the agreement was considered perfect and when it is equal to zero there is no agreement. They also calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of radiological comments on the comments intraoperatively, taken as the gold standard. the 0.05 significance level (α = 5%) was adopted.   RESULTS Regarding the biliary anatomy of 66 donors included in this study, only 27 cases (40.9%) had an anatomy of the bile ducts considered normal, ie Type I in intraoperative cholangiography. There anatomical variations donors in 20 (30.3%) in cholangiocarcinoma NMR donors and in 39 (69.7%) in intraoperative cholangiogram (Table 1).     In 19 donors (28.8%) to cholangiocarcinoma MRI showed biliary anatomy Type I, but disagreement with the intraoperative findings in two (3%) had a variation of Type II, 13 (19.69%) of type IV and four (6%) Type V. 17 (25.75%) were shown consistent preoperative anatomic variations with the findings of intraoperative. Among these a donor (1.51%) with variation of the type II a (1.51%) Type V, another (1.51%) 14 Type III and Type IV. Three (4.55%) presented different anatomical variations; in one (1.51%) classified as Type III in cholangiocarcinoma MRI showed the V type intraoperatively and the other two (3.02%) with variation of Type IV in cholangiocarcinoma RNM, one had Type III and other Type V in intraoperative findings. Therefore, 44 (66.6%) had concordant findings while in 22 (33.3%) the findings were discordant. Statistical analysis was moderate agreement between the two methods (Kappa = 0.46), and the sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma RNM 86%, while the specificity 61%, positive predictive value 49%, negative predictive value of 100 % and accuracy of 70%. Regarding the AH in all donors, the results of CT angiography were consistent with the intraoperative findings (100%) (Table 2).     Forty-five (68.2%) had normal anatomy, namely type I, seven (10.6%) type II, seven (10.6%) type III, two (3%) of type V, while two of type IX. The last three donors (4.5%) was anatomy of type XI, where the observed variation does not fit into any type described; translating into common hepatic artery, celiac trunk branch where after the origin of the upper gastroduodenal artery continued to own liver if trifurcando, yielding a left hepatic artery and two right, not being observed anatomical variations of types IV, VI, VII , VIII and X (Table 2). In turn CT angiography reproduced the intraoperative findings of the hepatic artery (Kappa = 1). With regard to VP, 46 donors (69.7%) had anatomy Type I agree with the findings of intraoperative with anatomical variations in 15 (22.72%) in imaging and in 20 (30, 3%) intraoperatively (Table 3).     In five cases (7.57%) that had Type I anatomy, variations were found during surgery, two (3.03%) with variations of Type II and three (4.54%) Type IV. Thirteen donors (19.7%) had anatomical variations by CT were confirmed intraoperatively. Among these, five (7.57%) Type II, seven (10.6%) of type IV and one (1.51%) of VIII type. In the remaining two (3.03%) anatomical variations found were discordant with surgical findings, classified as Type II preoperatively while intraoperative proved variation of Type IV, with 59 donors (89.4%) showing concordant and found only 7 (10.6%) were discordant. Statistical analysis reached Kappa 0.75. The sensitivity of CT was 87%, specificity 90%, positive predictive value of 65%, while the negative predictive value of 100% and accuracy was 89%.   DISCUSSION Liver transplantation is an effective treatment modality for a variety of irreversible liver disease and terminals, acute or chronic. The supply of organs, since from the beginning and even today has been one of the limiting factors in the survival of patients with liver failure who are in espera6 list. In 2009, the number of patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation in Brazil was 4,304 patients. Organ donation has increased in recent years, reaching 5.6 cadaveric donors values ​​of effective liver per million population in 2006, reaching 6.4 in 2008 and 7.0 in the year 20095. This number still proves to be very small compared to other countries like the United States that reaches 24 per million population and Spain, with 34 per million population, better mundo26 index. Liver transplantation inter vivos has several advantages with respect to liver transplantation using cadaveric donor generating direct increase in the number of organs available, reducing waiting time for cadaveric organ recipient, excellent viability of liver segment donated due to shorter graft ischemia and the possibility of carrying out the procedure eletiva7 medium. The priority in this type of intervention is the safety of the donor. Mancero et al. describe a 25% morbidity, with complication most often seen with biliary fistula, occurring in 8.8% of donors and a case of thrombosis of VP19. In 2003, in Japan, it described the first death of a doador1. One of the key points for the safety of the procedure lies in the prior knowledge of liver anatomy. Among the most common complications in both the donor and receiver, are the bile. In this sample 46 donors (69.7%) had a normal biliary cholangiocarcinoma in RM and twenty donors (30.3%) anatomical anomalies were found. However, during surgery it was observed that these changes corresponded to 39 donors (59.1%). In three donors (4.5%) there was trifurcation of the common hepatic duct. Two donors (3%) hepatic duct anterior or posterior right was united to the common hepatic duct. In 27 donors (40.9%) hepatic duct right before or after joined to the left hepatic duct. And seven donors (10.6%) all sector ducts drained separately, with no defined confluency. Biliary anatomical variations of this study showed a different incidence of previous reports in the literature. The anatomy of the confluence of the right and left ducts bilíferos shows mixed results. The pattern described as normal for the biliary tract, ie, the previous sectoral ducts and subsequent rights by joining to form the right hepatic duct which, in turn, joins the left hepatic duct to form the common hepatic duct was described in 57% of patients by Couinaud9 in 67.7% by Yoshida et al.30 and 62.2% by Huang et al.13. In the present study the biliary considered normal was observed in only 40.9%. The most frequently described anatomical variation is the trifurcation pattern of the common hepatic duct, identified by 19% by Huang et al.25 and 14.3% by Varotti et al.27, found in only 4.5% of our donors. Another frequent variation in the drain was in the previous duct or directly back right in the left hepatic described by Yoshida et al.30 in an incidence of 8% for the subsequent duct and 6% for the former, modification described in 24% by Couinaud9 and 20.8% by Varotti et al.27. In this study this branching pattern was the most observed anatomic variation present in 40.9% of donors, with no confluence defined in 10.9% of subjects, these findings higher than those found by Couinaud9 (3%) and Yoshida et al30 (0.5%). They also prove that 3% of our previous donors duct or higher-rights are joined to the common hepatic, incidence is slightly lower than that observed by Huang et al.13 (5%), Yoshida et al.30 (8%) and Couinaud9 (6%). The 66 donors who underwent CT angiography showed concordant findings AH, ie 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In this study, a normal arterial anatomy was observed in 68.2% of donors, a result that is similar to the Michels21 55%; 60% according to Schroeder et al.24; 59% by Duran et al.11; 70.8% by Varotti et al.27 and 75% by Freitas et al.12. 10.6% of donors AH left originated from the left gastric artery, findings consistent with 10% Michels21, 8% of Duran et a.l11. Discordant results were those presented by Saylisoy et al.23 4%, Tsang et al.25 in 3% and Schroeder et al.24 by 4%. Another common variation is shown AH right originating from the superior mesenteric artery, observed in 10.6% of our donors, like the 11% of Michels21, those found by Saylisoy et al.23 (10%), Schroeder et al. 24 (8.4%), Duran et al.11 (10%) and Freitas et al.12 (9%). Artioli et al.3 reported a higher incidence of this variation (15.6%), Tsang et al.25 reported lower icidência, 5.7% and Coskun et al.8 6.3%, a lower incidence. 3% of our donors was observed AH ancillary left, the left gastric artery branch. Modification observed in 7% 21 16.6% 8 16% 24% 9.8 25% 23 4 and by other researchers. Other 3% of donors to common AH originated from the superior mesenteric artery, a finding similar to the 2.5% found by Michels21 and 4% according to Duran et al.11, but slightly lower than in Sayisoy et al.23 who reported this type of variation in 6% and slightly higher than the 1.6% reported by Schodoeder et al.24. They could be classified 4.5% of donors, since the common AH, celiac trunk branch, after giving rise to higher gastroduodenal artery is continued as AH own trifurcava, yielding a left AH AH and two straight. Several authors reported changes that had not been described by Michels21 among these 13.6% according to Freitas et al.12, 16.6% according Coskun et al.8, 11% by Duran et al.11 and by 2.2% donors according to Tsang et al.13. According to the findings of CT angiography in 51 donors (77.3%) anatomy VP was normal and 15 (22.7%) donors had variations. In seven (10.6%) the main VP was formed by the confluence of the left branch and the anterior and posterior of the VP right - trifurcando up. In seven donors (10.6%) the right posterior branch drain directly on the main VP while the prior right to the VP and left this to the principal. A donor (1.5%) the main VP was formed by the confluence of the anterior and posterior of the VP right branches, and the VP left drained in the previous branch of the VP right. During the surgical procedure were observed anatomical variations of VP in 20 donors (30.3%). The anomalies were: seven (10.6%) with trifurcation of VP; in 12 (18.2%) the right posterior branch drain directly on the main VP while the prior right to the left and this VP to the main VP. In one donor (1.5%) main VP was formed by the confluence of branches, and further above VP right and left VP to VP anterior branch of the right. Such variants are descreitas by Tsang et al.25 in 14.7% of cases, while Covey et al.10 reported 35% Macdonald et al.18 reported 18% and Schroeder et al.24, Saylisoy et al.23 12% , Koç et al.15 21.5% with anatomical and Artioli et al.3 variations in only 9%. In short, cholangiocarcinoma RNM has moderate accuracy of 70%, with agreement of 66.6% of cases compared with intraoperative cholangiography; CT showed 100% agreement in the evaluation of arterial anatomy of donors, high accuracy (89%) in the identification of anatomical variations of VP and reproduced their surgical findings in 89.4% of cases.   CONCLUSION imaging methods are reliable in the evaluation of anatomical abnormalities of the portal vein and the hepatic artery, but need to be more accurate technique for bile duct.
