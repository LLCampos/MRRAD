 SUMMARY RATIONAL: A crucial aspect of liver transplantation inter vivos is the risk imposed to the donor due to be procedure performed on a healthy person, with the possibility of high post-operative morbidity. OBJECTIVE: to Correlate the findings of the image of the pre and intra-operative care of donors, adult living liver. METHODS: In the period from 2003 to 2008 were reviewed the charts of 66 donors. Were 42 men (64%) and 24 women (36%), with a mean age of 30 years (± 8 years). The anatomy and pre-operative was analysed by means of cholangiography by magnetic resonance imaging to study the bile ducts, and angiography by computed tomography for hepatic artery and portal vein. Criteria of normality were established according to previous studies in the literature. RESULTS: anatomic Variations of the bile ducts were found in 59.1% of donors; the hepatic artery in 31.8% and of the portal vein in 30.3% of the cases in the preoperative period. The cholangiography by magnetic resonance imaging showed findings concordant in 44 (66,6%) donors and discordant in 22 (33.3 percent). With respect to the hepatic artery in all donors the findings of the examination of the image were in agreement with the intra-operative period. To the portal vein computed tomography showed findings concordant in 59 (89,4%) donors and discordant in seven (10.6 percent). CONCLUSIONS: The anatomical variations of the bile ducts are frequent, with cholangiography by magnetic resonance imaging showing the accuracy was moderate (70%) in the reproduction of findings surgical; the computed tomography reproduced the findings of the intra-operative hepatic artery in 100% of donors, and reproduced the intraoperative findings in 89.4% of cases in relation to the portal vein, showing the accuracy was high (89%).

Care for pre-operative INTRODUCTION In 1988, in Brazil, Raia et al.22, carried out the first liver transplantation inter vivos, using the lobe liver left (segments II and III) of a donor adult transplanted into a receiver in the paediatric population. In 1994, Yamoaka et al.28, with experience of more than 200 transplants paediatric carried out, reported the first transplantation inter vivos successful among adults, using lobe liver right. A crucial question to this modality of liver transplantation lies in the risk imposed on the donor by the application of the procedure to a healthy individual that is able to generate index of postoperative morbidity that may reach 21% and mortality of 0.5%17. One of the causes for these high rates of complications appear to relate to the large number of anatomical variations of the vascular and duct bilíferos not recognized in the pre-operatório14. Anatomic variations of the hepatic artery (AH) is commonly found in about 45% of the cases of potential living donors of fígado13,21,27. The identification of the origin of the branch artery supplying the segment IV is also very important, because your integrity is indispensable for that to occur the regeneration of the wolf liver esquerdo20. Changes of the portal vein (PV) can be found in about 20% of this population and, although these do not constitute, usually, in contraindication to the transplantation, may, once recognized, make the surgical procedure more lengthy, require multiple anastomoses increasing the risk of tromboses10,15. This concern expands, as only about 60% of the donors have a anatomy of the ducts bilíferos conventional, variations of which provide major technical challenges for the realization of liver transplantation inter vivos, or even may represent a contraindication to the doação12,16,19. So it requires perfect knowledge of the pre-operative anatomy of the elements of the triad portal of the donors aiming to simplify the procedure of reconstruction, both of the vascular structures and bile. In addition, it reduces the rate of postoperative morbidity of the receivers at the same time increase the quality of the graft and the security and donor selection, when multiple candidates are disponíveis4,24. To do this, has been relying on the angiography by computed tomography (angio-CT) and cholangiography by magnetic resonance imaging (colangio-NMR), used as a pre-operative exams with the intention to analyze anatomical variations of the triad portal4,19,24. The aim of this study was to correlate findings of image in the pre-operative with those found in the intra-operative donor adult living liver. METHODS Were evaluated, retrospectively, in the Hospital Beneficência Portuguesa of São Paulo, the medical charts of 66 donors for liver transplantation inter vivos, in the period between 2003 and 2008. Forty two (64%) were males and 24 (36%) females, with age ranging between 19 and 50, and with an average of 30 years (± 8 years), body mass index (BMI) ranging between 19.8 and the 38.2 Kg/m2 and mean of 25.7 Kg/m2 (± 3,9). The classification used for the description of the anatomical variations of the ducts bilíferos was proposed by Couinaud9; for AH, for Michels21 and to the VP by Akgul et al.2. Exam protocol image Colangio-NMR Were used mri machines of 1.5 T (G. E.® Excite HD) coils and the surface. Was asked to fast for 6 to 8 h to patients and administered 20 mg of butilbrometo of scopolamine I. V. (except in patients with allergy or glaucoma) minutes prior to placement in the apparatus to reduce artifacts from peristalsis. After sequences localizadoras were obtained from series Fast Spin Echo T2 axial with saturation of fat, with the parameters: TE/TR 85/2000-2500 ms, FOV of 40 mm and slice thickness of 6 mm with an interval of 2 mm. The series colangiográficas were obtained in sequences of volumetric Fast Recovery Fast Spin Echo coronal, trigadas with the patient's breathing with TE/TR of 400/5000-12000 ms, and FOV of 38 mm, the sequences T2 Single-Shot Fast Spin Echo radial, centered on the colédoco, with TE/TR of 400/2000 ms, and FOV of 28 mm and stream FIESTA® (Fast Imaging Employing Steady State Acquistion) volumetric coronal with TR/TE minimum, thickness of 3-3,6 mm and FOV of 38 mm. In some patients were obtained even sequence, axial T1 Gradient echo L. A. V. A.® (Liver acquisition with volume aceleration) volume with TE/TR minimum thickness of 5 mm and FOV of 40 mm before and after injection of gadolinium (0.2 ml/kg of patient weight). The exam time was between 20-30 minutes, and the images were sent to workstation dedicated to the manipulation. Angio-CT Were used devices multidetectores with 16 and 64 channels (LighSpeed - GE®, Aquilion 16-and 64 - Toshiba® SOMATOM 128 - Siemens®), after intravenous injection of 75-150mL of contrast iodinated non-ionic through the pump injector at speeds of 3-5 ml/s, with cuts of 1-1,25 mm reconstructed at 0.8-1 mm. Were purchased in phases, arterial, portal venous, this last obtained only in patients with opacification of venous unsatisfactory. All the series were sent for analysis on workstations dedicated to you. Statistical analysis For the study of the reproducibility between two qualitative variables, we used the coefficient of concordance Kappa, which ranges from zero to one. When it was equal to a, the agreement was considered perfect and when it is equal to zero there is no agreement. Were also calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, positive and negative, and the accuracy of the observations radiological regard to the observations on the intra-operative period, taken as the gold standard. We adopted the significance level of 0.05 (α=5%). RESULTS In relation to the biliary anatomy of the 66 donors included in the present study, only 27 cases (40,9%) presented an anatomy of the bile ducts considered normal, or is Type I in the intraoperative cholangiography. There were anatomical variations in 20 donors (30.3%) in the colangio-NMR and in 39 donors (69,7%) in the intraoperative cholangiography (Table 1). In 19 donors (28,8%) the colangio-NMR showed the biliary anatomy of the Type I, but discordant findings of the intra-operative period, in which two (3%) had a variation of Type II, 13 (19,69%) Type IV, and four (6%) of Type V. 17 (25,75%) were evidenced anatomical variations of pre-operative, in accordance with the findings of the intra-operative period. Between these a donor (1,51%) with variation of Type II, one (1,51%) of Type V, the other (1,51%) of Type III and 14 Type IV. Three (4,55%) presented anatomical variations discordant; in a (1,51%) classified as Type III in the colangio-NMR showed the Type V in the intra-operative period and the other two (3,02%) with variation of Type IV in the colangio-NMR, one was Type III and another Type V in the intraoperative findings. Therefore, 44 (66,6%) showed findings consistent while in 22 (33,3%) the findings were discordant. In statistical analysis there was agreement moderate between the two methods (Kappa=0.46 to), being the sensitivity of the colangio-NMR was 86%, while the specificity was 61%, the positive predictive value of 49%, the negative predictive value of 100% and accuracy of 70%. With respect to the AH in all donors, the results of the angio-CT were in agreement with the findings of the intra-operative (100%) (Table 2). Forty-five (68,2%) had a normal anatomy, that is, of type I, seven (10,6%), type II, seven (10.6 per cent) of type III, two (3%) of type V, while the other two of type IX. The last three donors (4.5%) and the anatomy was of type XI, where the observed variation does not fit into any type described; translating into common hepatic artery, branch of the celiac trunk where after the origin of the artery, gastro-duodenal, superior continued as the liver itself, trifurcando, resulting in a hepatic artery left and two rights, not being observed anatomical variations of the types IV, VI, VII, VIII and X (Table 2). The angio-CT was reproduced the findings of the intra-operative hepatic artery (Kappa = 1). In regards to VP, 46 donors (69,7%) had a anatomy of Type I in agreement with the findings of the intra-operative period, with anatomical variations in 15 (22,72%) in the examinations of image, and in 20 (30.3%) in the intra-operative period (Table 3). In five cases (7,57%) that had anatômia Type I, were found variations during the surgical act, two (3,03%) with variations of Type II and the other three (was 4.54%) Type IV. Thirteen donors (by 19.7%) presented anatomical variations of the CT scan that were confirmed intra-operatively. Among these, five (7,57%) Type II, seven (10,6%), Type IV, and one (1,51%) Type VIII. In the remaining two (3,03%) the anatomical variations found were discordant with the findings of surgical patients, classified as Type II in the pre-operative period while the intra-operative period has been shown to be variation of Type IV, with 59 donors (89,4%) presenting findings in agreement and only 7 (10,6%) were discordant. In the statistical analysis reached a Kappa of 0.75. The sensitivity of CT was 87%, the specificity 90%, positive predictive value of 65%, while the negative predictive value of 100% and accuracy was 89%. DISCUSSION liver transplantation is a therapeutic modality effective for a variety of liver diseases irreversible and terminal, acute or chronic. The supply of organs, already from the beginning and still today, has been one of the limiting factors in the survival of patients with liver failure who are in the list of espera6. In the year 2009, the number of patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation in Brazil was 4.304 patients. Organ donation has increased in recent years, reaching values of 5.6 donors cadavéricos liver effective per million of population in 2006, rising to 6.4 in 2008 and 7.0 in the year 20095. This number also demonstrates to be very small in comparison with other countries such as the United States that arrives to 24 per million of population, and Spain, with 34 per million of population, the best index of the mundo26. Liver transplantation inter vivos presents several advantages with respect to liver transplantation using donor cadaveric generating increased straight from the number of available organs, reduction of the waiting time for the receiver body cadaveric, excellent viability of the segment of the liver donated, due to the shorter ischemia time of the graft and the possibility of carrying out the procedure eletiva7. The priority of this type of intervention is the safety of the donor. Mancero et al. describe an index of morbidity of 25%, with complication more frequently observed being biliary fistula, occurring in 8.8% of the donors and a case of thrombosis of VP19. In the year 2003, in Japan, it was described the first death of a doador1. One of the key points for the safety of the procedure lies in the prior knowledge of the anatomy of the liver. Among the most common complications, both on the giver and the receiver, are the bile. In this sample 46 donors (69,7%) were via the bile in normal colangio-RM, and in twenty donors (up 30.3%) were found to have anatomical abnormalities. However, during the surgical act, it was observed that these changes accounted for 39 donors (59,1%). In three donors (4.5%) and there was trifurcação of the common hepatic duct. Two donors (3%) the hepatic duct right anterior or posterior linked to the common hepatic duct. In 27 other donors (40,9%) the hepatic duct right anterior or posterior linked to the hepatic duct left. And in seven donors (10,6%) all ducts sectoral drenavam separately, with the absence of confluence set. The anatomical variations of the bile of this study showed an incidence different from the previous reports in the literature. The anatomy of the confluence of the ducts bilíferos the right and left displays diverse results. The pattern described as normal for the bile ducts, or the ducts the sector earlier and later rights, uniting to form the hepatic duct right that, in turn, joins the hepatic duct to the left, forming the common hepatic duct, was described in 57% of patients by Couinaud9, in the 67.7% by Yoshida et al.30 and the 62,2% by Huang et al.13. In the present study via the bile considered normal was observed in only to 40.9%. The anatomical variation more frequently described is the standard trifurcação of the common hepatic duct, identified by 19% by Huang et al.25 and 14.3% by Varotti et al.27, being found in only 4.5% of our donors. Another variation frequently displayed was the drainage of the duct preceding or subsequent right directly in the liver to the left, as described by Yoshida et al.30 at an incidence of 8% for the duct later, and 6% for the previous modification described in 24% by Couinaud9 and 20.8% by Varotti et al.27. In this study, this pattern of branching was the anatomical variation more observed, this 40.9% of donors, with the absence of confluence was set at 10.9% of the individuals found these superior to those found by Couinaud9 (3%) and by Yoshida et al.30 (0,5%). Prove yet, that 3% of our donors the duct preceding or subsequent rights were joined to the common hepatic, incidence is slightly lower than that observed by Huang et al.13 (5%), Yoshida et al.30 (8%) and by Couinaud9 (6%). The 66 donors who carried out the angio-CT showed the findings of the AH concordant, that is, 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In the present study, it was observed a anatomy, normal blood in 68.2% of donors, a result that resembles those of Michels21 in 55%; 60% in the second Schoroeder et al.24; 59% by Duran et al.11; 70,8% by Varotti et al.27, and in 75% by Freitas et al.12. At 10.6% of the donors in the AH left originated from the left gastric artery, findings concordant to 10% of Michels21, 8% Duran et a. l11. Discordant results of these were presented by Saylisoy et al.23 4%), Tsang et al.25 in 3% and Schoroeder et al.24 at 4%. Another variation frequently displayed was the AH right originating from the superior mesenteric artery, was observed in 10.6% of our donors, similar to the 11% of Michels21, to those found by Saylisoy et al.23 (10%), Schoroeder et al.24 (8.4 percent), Duran et al.11 (10%) and Freitas et al.12 (9%). Artioli et al.3 report a higher incidence of this variation (15,6%), Tsang et al.25 report icidência less, 5.7%, and Coskun et al.8 6.3%, a lower incidence. In 3% of our donors was observed a AH left, accessory branch of the left gastric artery. Modification observed in 7%to 21, at 16.6%8, 16%24, 9,8%25 4%23 by other researchers. In another 3% of the donors in the AH the common resulted from the superior mesenteric artery, found this similar to the 2.5% found by Michels21 and 4% according to Duran et al.11, but slightly lower than that of Sayisoy et al.23 that refer to this type of variation in 6% and slightly higher than the 1.6% described by Schodoeder et al.24. Could not be classified 4.5% of the donors, because the AH common, branch of the celiac trunk, after giving origin to the artery gastro-duodenal upper continued as OH own and trifurcava, resulting in a AH left, and two AH right. Several authors refer to changes that had not been described by Michels21, between these and 13.6% according to Freitas et al.12, to 16.6% according to Coskun et al.8, 11% by Duran et al.11 and in 2.2% of donors in accordance with Tsang et al.13. According to the findings of angio-CT in 51 donors (77,3%) the anatomy of the PV was normal, and 15 (22.7 percent) donors were variations. In seven (10.6 percent) the VP was formed by the confluence of the branch to the left and the previous and later of VP right - trifurcando. In the other seven donors (10,6%) the right branch later drenava directly to the VP principal while the prior right to the VP and left this to the main. A donor (1,5%) the PV was formed by the confluence of the branches back from the VP to the right, and the VP left drenava in the branch preceding the VP right. During the surgical act have been observed anatomical variations of VP in 20 donors (by 30.3%). The anomalies found were: seven (10.6 percent) with trifurcação of the VP; in 12 (18,2%) the right branch later drenava directly to the VP principal while the prior right to the VP and left this to the VP of the main. In a donor (1,5%) the PV was formed by the confluence of the branches back from the VP to the right, and the VP left for the branch preceding the VP right. Such variants are descreitas by Tsang et al.25 in 14.7% of cases, while Covey et al.10 report 35%, Macdonald et al.18 refers to 18% and Schoroeder et al.24, Saylisoy et al.23 12%, Koç et al.15 21.5% of the variations in the anatomical and Artioli et al.3 in only 9%. In summary, the colangio-NMR displays the accuracy was moderate in 70%, with agreement of 66.6% of the cases in relation to intraoperative cholangiography; CT showed 100% concordance in the assessment of anatomy, blood donor, high accuracy (89%) in the identification of anatomic variations of VP and played their findings surgical in 89.4% of cases. CONCLUSION imaging methods are reliable in the evaluation of anatomical abnormalities of the portal vein and the hepatic artery, but you need technique more accurate for via the bile.
