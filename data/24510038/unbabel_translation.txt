ABSTRACT: A crucial aspect of living donor liver transplantation is the risk posed to the donor due to the conduction of the procedure in a healthy person, while there's a possibility of high postoperative morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To correlate imaging findings of pre and intraoperative of living liver donors adults. METHODS: Between 2003-2008, the charts of 66 donors were reviewed. There were 42 men (64%) and 24 women (36%) with an average age of 30 years old (± 8 years). Preoperative anatomy was analyzed by cholangiography with magnetic resonance imaging to study the bile ducts, and computed tomography angiography for hepatic artery and portal vein. Normality criteria were established according to previous studies from literature. RESULTS: Anatomical variations of the bile ducts were found in 59.1% of donors; of the hepatic artery in 31.8% and of the portal vein in 30.3% of preoperative cases. Cholangiography magnetic resonance imaging showed concordant findings in 44 (66.6%) donors and discordant findings in 22 (33.3%). Regarding the hepatic artery, the findings of imaging were consistent with the intraoperative in all donors. For the portal vein, CT showed concordant findings in 59 donors (89.4%) and discordant in seven (10.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The anatomical variations of bile ducts are frequent, with cholangiography by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging showing moderate accuracy (70%) reproducing surgical findings; CT reproduced the intraoperative findings of the hepatic artery in 100% of donors, and reproduced the intraoperative findings in 89.4% of cases in the portal vein, presenting high accuracy (89%). Key words: Liver transplantation. Alive donors. Magnetic resonance imaging. X-ray tomography. Preoperative care INTRODUCTION In 1988, in Brazil, Raia et al.22 performed the first living donor liver transplantation, using the left hepatic lobe (segments II and III) of an adult donor transplanted into a pediatric recipient. In 1994, Yamoaka et al.28, with the expertise of more than 200 pediatric transplants performed, reported the first successful living donor liver transplantation among adults, using the right hepatic lobe. A crucial issue to this form of liver transplantation lies in the risk posed to the donor by the application of the procedure to a healthy individual, since the procedure is capable of generating postoperative morbidity rate that can reach 21% and 0.5% mortality17. One reason for the high rates of complications seems to be related to the large number of vascular anatomical variations and bile ducts not recognized in the preoperative 14. Anatomical variations of hepatic artery (HA) are commonly found in about 45% of cases of potential living liver donors 13,21,27. The identification of the source of the arterial branch source irrigating the IV segment is also very important, because its integrity is essential to the regeneration of the left hepatic lobe 20. Changes in the portal vein (PV) can be found in about 20% of that population and, although they do not constitute normally a contraindication to transplantation, they can, once recognized, make the surgical procedure longer, requiring multiple anastomoses, increasing the risk of thromboses10,15. This concern increases, because only about 60% of donors have a conventional anatomy of biliferous ducts, variations that provide great technical challenges for the realization of living donor liver transplantation or may represent contraindication to the donation12,16,19. Thus it is required perfect preoperative knowledge of the anatomy of the elements in the portal triad of the donor to simplify the reconstruction procedure, both of vascular and biliary structures. In addition, that also reduces the postoperative morbidity rate of the receptors while increasing the quality of graft and safety and donor selection, when several candidates are available. To that effect, computed tomography angiography (CTA) and cholangiography by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI cholangiocarcinoma) are being used as preoperative tests, intended to analyze anatomical variations of the portal triad4,19,24. The aim of this study was to correlate imaging findings in preoperative with those found in intraoperative of adults living liver donors.   METHODS We evaluated retrospectively in the Portuguese Charitable Hospital of São Paulo, the charts of 66 donors for living donor liver transplantation in the period between 2003 and 2008. Forty-two (64%) were male and 24 (36%) females, aged between 19 and 50 with an average of 30 years (± 8 years), body mass index (BMI) ranging from 19, 8 and 38.2 kg/m2 and average of 25.7 kg/m2 (± 3.9). The classification used for the description of the anatomical variations of biliferous ducts was proposed by Couinaud9; for the HA, for Michels21 and PV by Akgul et al.2. Cholangiocarcinoma MRI imaging protocol 
MRI machines to 1.5T (GE ® Excite HD) and surface coils were used. Fasting of 6 to 8h was required to the patients and 20 mg of scopolamine butylbromide IV was administered (Except in patients with allergy or glaucoma) minutes before positioning the device to reduce peristalsis artifacts. After localization sequences, series axial fast spin echo T2 with fat saturation with the following parameters: TE/TR 85/2000-2500 ms, FOV of 40 mm and 6 mm slice thickness with 2 mm interval were obtained. The cholangiographic series were obtained in coronal volumetric sequences Fast Recovery Fast Spin Echo, triggered with the patient's breathing with TE /TR 400/5000-12000 ms and FOV of 38 mm T2 sequences Single Shot Fast Spin Echo radial, centered on the common bile duct with TE /TR 400/2000 ms and FOV of 28 mm and FIESTA® (Fast Imaging Employing Steady State Acquistion) coronal volume sequence with TR /TE minimal, thickness of 3 to 3.6 mm and FOV of 38 mm. In some patients volumetric axial sequence Gradient echo T1 LAVA® (Liver aquisition with aceleration volume) with TE/TR minimal thickness of 5 mm and FOV of 40 mm before and after gadolinium injection (0.2 ml/kg of patient weight) were found. The examination time ranged from 20-30 minutes and the images were sent to workstations dedicated to manipulation. CT angiography Multidetector devices with 16 and 64 channels (LighSpeed - GE®, Aquilion 16 and 64 - and Toshiba® SOMATOM 128 - Siemens®) after intravenous injection 75-150mL of nonionic iodinated contrast through pump injection speeds of 3-5 ml / s, with 1-1.25 mm reconstructed 0.8-1 mm cuts were used.  The arterial, portal and venous phases were acquired, the latter only in patients with poor venous opacification. All series were sent for analysis on dedicated workstations. Statistical analysis To study the reproducibility between two qualitative variables, we used the Kappa coefficient, which ranges from zero to one. When it was equal to one, the agreement was considered perfect and when it was equal to zero there was no agreement. They also calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of radiological comments compared to the intraoperative comments, taken as the gold standard.  0.05 significance level (α = 5%) was adopted.   RESULTS Regarding the biliary anatomy of the 66 donors included in this study, only 27 cases (40.9%) had the anatomy of the bile ducts considered normal, i.e. Type I in intraoperative cholangiography. There were anatomical variations in 20 donors (30.3%) in cholangiocarcinoma NMR and in 39 donors (69.7%) in intraoperative cholangiogram (Table 1).     In 19 donors (28.8%), cholangiocarcinoma MRI showed biliary anatomy Type I, but it was discordant with the intraoperative findings, in which two (3%) had a variation of Type II, 13 (19.69%) of type IV and four (6%) of Type V. In 17 (25.75%) there were concordant preoperative anatomic variations with the findings of intraoperative. Among these, a donor (1.51%) with variation of the type II, one (1.51%) Type V, another (1.51%) Type III and14 Type IV. Three (4.55%) presented different anatomical variations; in one (1.51%) classified as Type III in cholangiocarcinoma MRI, the V type was classified intraoperatively and the other two (3.02%) with variation of Type IV in cholangiocarcinoma RNM, one had Type III and other Type V in intraoperative findings. Therefore, 44 (66.6%) had concordant findings while in 22 (33.3%) the findings were discordant. In the statistical analysis there was moderate agreement between the two methods (Kappa = 0.46), the sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma MRI being 86%, while the specificity 61%, positive predictive value 49%, negative predictive value of 100 % and accuracy of 70%. Regarding the HA in all donors, the results of CT angiography were concordant with the intraoperative findings (100%) (Table 2).     Forty-five (68.2%) had normal anatomy, namely type I, seven (10.6%) type II, seven (10.6%) type III, two (3%) of type V, while two were type IX. In the last three donors (4.5%), the anatomy was of type XI, where the observed variation does not fit into any type described; translating into common hepatic artery, celiac trunk branch where after the origin of the upper gastroduodenal artery continues as hepatic itself, trifurcating, yielding a left hepatic artery and two right, not being observed anatomical variations of types IV, VI, VII, VIII and X (Table 2). On the other hand, CT angiography reproduced the intraoperative findings of the hepatic artery (Kappa = 1). With regard to PV, 46 donors (69.7%) had anatomy Type I, concordant with the findings of the intraoperative, with anatomical variations in 15 (22.72%) in the imaging exams and in 20 (30, 3%) in intraoperative(Table 3).     In five cases (7.57%) that had Type I anatomy, variations were found during surgery, two (3.03%) with variations of Type II and three (4.54%)of Type IV. Thirteen donors (19.7%) who showed anatomical variations in CT were confirmed intraoperatively. Among these, five (7.57%) of Type II, seven (10.6%) of type IV and one (1.51%) of Type VIII. In the two remaining (3.03%), the anatomical variations that were found were discordant with the surgical findings, classified as Type II preoperatively, while intraoperative proved to be the variation of Type IV, with 59 donors (89.4%) showing concordant findings and only 7 (10.6%) discordant. Statistical analysis reached Kappa 0.75. The sensitivity of CT was 87%, specificity 90%, positive predictive value of 65%, while the negative predictive value of 100% and accuracy was 89%.   DISCUSSION Liver transplantation is an effective treatment modality for a variety of irreversible and terminal, acute or chronic liver diseases. The supply of organs, since the beginning and even today has been one of the limiting factors in the survival of patients with liver failure in the waiting list6. In 2009, the number of patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation in Brazil was 4,304 patients. Organ donation has increased in recent years, reaching values of 5.6 cadaveric donors of effective liver per million population in 2006, reaching 6.4 in 2008 and 7.0 in the year 20095. This number still proves to be very small compared to other countries, such as the United States, that reaches 24 per million population and Spain, with 34 per million population, better index in the world26. Living donor liver transplantation has several advantages compared to liver transplantation using cadaveric donor, generating direct increase in the number of available organs, reducing waiting time for the recipient of the cadaveric organ, excellent viability of liver segment donated, due to shorter graft ischemia time and the possibility of carrying out the procedure by choice. The priority in this type of intervention is the safety of the donor. Mancero et al. describe a 25% morbidity rate, with the biliary fistula being the complication most often seen, occurring in 8.8% of donors and a case of thrombosis of PV19. In 2003, in Japan, was described the first death of a donor1. One of the key points for the safety of the procedure lies in the prior knowledge of the liver anatomy. Among the most common complications in both the donor and receiver, are the biliary. In this sample 46 donors (69.7%) had a normal biliary duct in cholangiocarcinomaMRI and in twenty donors (30.3%) anatomical anomalies were found. However, during surgery it was observed that these changes corresponded to 39 donors (59.1%). In three donors (4.5%) there was trifurcation of the common hepatic duct. In two donors (3%), the hepatic duct anterior or posterior right was united to the common hepatic duct. In 27 donors (40.9%), the hepatic duct right before or after joined to the left hepatic duct. And sin even donors (10.6%), all sector ducts drained separately, with no defined confluency. Biliary anatomical variations of this study showed different incidences from previous reports in the literature. The anatomy of the confluence of the right and left biliary ducts shows mixed results. The pattern described as normal for the biliary tract, i.e., right posterior and anterior sectoral ducts joining to form the right hepatic duct which, joins the left hepatic duct to form the common hepatic duct was described in 57% of patients by Couinaud9 in 67.7% by Yoshida et al.30 and 62.2% by Huang et al.13. In the present study the biliary duct considered normal was observed in only 40.9%. The most frequently described anatomical variation is the trifurcation pattern of the common hepatic duct, identified by 19% by Huang et al.25 and 14.3% by Varotti et al.27, found in only 4.5% of our donors. Another frequent variation was drainage of right anterior or posterior duct directly in the left hepatic, described by Yoshida et al.30 in an incidence of 8% for the posterior duct and 6% for the anterior, modification described in 24% by Couinaud9 and 20.8% by Varotti et al.27. In this study this branching pattern was the most observed anatomic variation, present in 40.9% of donors, with no confluence defined in 10.9% of subjects - these findings were higher than those found by Couinaud9 (3%) and Yoshida et al30 (0.5%). They also prove that in 3% of our donors the right anterior or posterior ducts joined the common hepatic duct, incidence slightly lower than the observed by Huang et al.13 (5%), Yoshida et al.30 (8%) and Couinaud9 (6%). The 66 donors who underwent CT angiography showed concordant findings of HA, in other words, 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In this study, a normal arterial anatomy was observed in 68.2% of donors, a result that is similar to the Michels21 in 55%; 60% according to Schroeder et al.24; 59% by Duran et al.11; 70.8% by Varotti et al.27 and 75% by Freitas et al.12. In 10.6% of donors left HA originated from the left gastric artery, findings concordant with 10% Michels21, 8% of Duran et a.l11. Discordant results were those presented by Saylisoy et al.23 4%, Tsang et al.25 in 3% and Schroeder et al.24 by 4%. Another common variation shown was the right HA originating from the superior mesenteric artery, observed in 10.6% of our donors, similar to the 11% of Michels 21, those found by Saylisoy et al. 23 (10%), Schroeder et al. 24 (8.4%), Duran et al.11 (10%) and Freitas et al.12 (9%). Artioli et al.3 reported a higher incidence of this variation (15.6%), Tsang et al.25 reported lower incidence, 5.7% and Coskun et al.8 6.3%, a lower incidence. In 3% of our donors a HA ancillary left was observed, a branch of the left gastric artery. Modification observed in 7% 21 16.6% 8 16% 24% 9.8 25% 23 4 and by other researchers. In other 3% of donors, common HA originated from the superior mesenteric artery, a finding similar to the 2.5% found by Michels21 and 4% according to Duran et al.11, but slightly lower than in Sayisoy et al.23 who reported this type of variation in 6% and slightly higher than the 1.6% reported by Schodoeder et al.24. 4.5% of donors could not be classified, since the common HA, celiac trunk branch, after giving rise to higher gastroduodenal artery is continued as HA and trifurcated itself, yielding a left HA and two right HAs. Several authors reported changes that had not been described by Michels21, among these 13.6% according to Freitas et al.12, 16.6% according Coskun et al.8, 11% by Duran et al.11 and in 2.2% donors according to Tsang et al.13. According to the findings of CT angiography, in 51 donors (77.3%), the anatomy of PV was normal and 15 (22.7%) donors had variations. In seven (10.6%) the main PV was formed by the confluence of the left branch and the anterior and posterior of the right PV - trifurcating itself. In seven donors (10.6%) the right posterior branch drained directly to the main PV while the anterior right to the left PV and then to the main. In one donor (1.5%), the main PV was formed by the confluence of the anterior and posterior of the PV right branches, and the left PV drained in the anterior branch of the right PV. During the surgical procedure anatomical variations of PV were observed in 20 donors (30.3%). The anomalies were: 7 (10.6%) with trifurcation of the PV; 12 (18.2%) with right posterior branch drained directly to the main PV while the anterior right to the left PV and then to the main PV. In one donor (1.5%) the main PV was formed by the confluence of posterior and anterior branches of the right PV and left PV to the anterior branch of the right. Such variations are described by Tsang et al.25 in 14.7% of cases, while Covey et al.10 reported 35% Macdonald et al.18 reported 18% and Schroeder et al.24, Saylisoy et al.23 12%, Koç et al.15 21.5% anatomical variations and Artioli et al.3 in only 9%. In short, cholangiocarcinoma-MRI has moderate accuracy of 70%, with agreement of 66.6% of cases compared with intraoperative cholangiography; CT showed 100% agreement in the evaluation of arterial anatomy of donors, high accuracy (89%) in the identification of anatomical variations of PV and reproduced their surgical findings in 89.4% of cases.   CONCLUSION imaging methods are reliable in the evaluation of anatomical abnormalities of the portal vein and the hepatic artery, but a more accurate technique is needed for the biliary tract.
